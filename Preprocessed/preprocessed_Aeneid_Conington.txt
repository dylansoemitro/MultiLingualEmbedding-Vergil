unforgetting hate much laboured too in battlefield striving his city’s walls to build ⁠and give his gods a home thence come the hardy latin brood the ancient sires of alba’s blood ⁠and loftyrampired rome ⁠say muse for godhead how disdained or wherefore wroth heaven’s queen constrained that soul of piety so long to turn the wheel to cope with wrong can heavenly natures nourish hate so fierce so blindly passionate ⁠there stood a city on the sea manned by a tyrian colony named carthage fronting far to south italia’s coast and tibers mouth rich in all wealth all means of rule and hardened in wars sternest school men say the place was junos pride more than all lands on earth beside een samos self not half so dear here were her arms her chariot here here goddesslike to fix one day the seat of universal sway might fate be wrung to yield assent een then her schemes her cares were bent yet had she heard that sons of troy were born her carthage to destroy from those majestic loins should spring a nation like a warrior king ordained for libyas overthrow the web of fate was woven so this was her fear and fear renewed the memory of that earlier feud the war at troy she erst had waged in darling argos cause engaged nor yet had faded from her view the insults whence those angers grew deep in remembrance lives engrained the judgment which her charms disdained the offspring of adulterous seed the rape of minion ganymede with such resentments brimming oer she tossed and tossed from shore to shore the trojan bands poor relics these of achillean victories away from latium many a year fatedriven they wandered far and near so vast the labour to create the fabric of the roman state ⁠scarce out of sight of sicily troys crews were spreading sail to sea ⁠pleased oer the foam to run when juno feeding ever more the vulture at her bosoms core ⁠thus to herself begun i to give way has juno willed and must her will he unfulfilled too weak from latiums coast to fling back to the sea this trojan king restrained by fate could pallas fire the argive fleet to wreak her ire and drown the crews for one offence mad ajax curst incontinence she from the clouds joves lightning cast dispersed the ships the billows massed caught the scathed wretch whose breast exhaled fierce flames and on a rock impaled i who through heaven its mistress move the sister and the wife of jove with one poor tribe of earth contend long years revolving without end will any junos power adore henceforth or crown her altars more ⁠such fiery tumult in her mind she seeks the birthplace of the wind æolia realm for ever rife with turbid elemental life here æolus in a cavern vast with bolt and barrier fetters fast rebellious storm and howling blast they with the rocks reverberant roar chafe blustering round their prisondoor he throned on high the sceptre sways controls their moods their wrath allays break but that sceptre sea and land ⁠and heavens etherial deep before them they would whirl like sand ⁠and through the void air sweep but the great sire with prescient fear had whelmed them deep in dungeon drear and oer the struggling captives thrown huge masses of primeval stone ruled by a monarch who might know to curb them or to let them go whom now as suppliant at his knees juno bespoke in words like these o æolus since the sire of all has made the wind obey thy call ⁠to raise or lay the foam a race i hate now ploughs the sea transporting troy to italy ⁠and homegods reft of home lash thou thy winds their ships submerge or toss them weltering oer the surge twice seven bright nymphs attend on me the fairest of them deiope her will i give thee for thine own the partner of thy heart and throne with thee to pass unending days and goodly children round thee raise the god replies o queen tis thine to weigh thy will to do it mine thou givest me this poor kingdom thou hast smoothed for me the thunderers brow givest me to share the olympian board and oer the tempests makest me lord ⁠he said and with his spear struck wide the portals in the mountain side at once like soldiers in a band forth rush the winds and scour the land then lighting heavily on the main east south and west with storms in train heave from its depth the watery floor and roll great billows to the shore then come the clamour and the shriek the sailors shout the mainropes creak all in a moment sun and skies are blotted from the trojans eyes black night is brooding oer the deep sharp thunder peals live lightnings leap the stoutest warrior holds his breath and looks as on the face of death at once æneas thrilled with dread forth from his breast with hands outspread ⁠these groaning words he drew o happy thrice and yet again who died at troy like valiant men ⁠een in their parents view o diomed first of greeks in fray why pressed i not the plain that day ⁠yielding my life to you where stretched beneath a phrygian sky fierce hector tall sarpedon lie where simois tumbles neath his wave shields helms and bodies of the brave ⁠now howling from the north the gale while thus he moans him strikes his sail the swelling surges climb the sky the shattered oars in splinters fly the prow turns round and to the tide lays broad and bare the vessels side on comes a billow mountainsteep bears down and tumbles in a heap these stagger on the billows crest those to the yawning depth deprest see land appearing mid the waves while surf with sand in turmoil raves three ships the south has caught and thrown on scarce hid rocks as altars known ridging the main a reef of stone three more fierce eurus from the deep a sight to make the gazer weep drives on the shoals and banks them round with sand as with a rampiremound one which erewhile from lycias shore orontes and his people bore een in æneas anguished sight a sea down crashing from the height strikes full astern the pilot torn from off the helm is headlong borne three turns the foundered vessel gave then sank beneath the engulfing wave there in the vast abyss are seen the swimmers few and far between and warriors arms and shattered wood and trojan treasures strew the flood and now ilioneus and now ⁠aletes old and grey abas and brave achates bow ⁠beneath the tempests sway fast drinking in through timbers loose at every pore the fatal ooze ⁠their sturdy barks give way ⁠meantime the turmoil of the main the tempest loosened from its chain the waters of the nether deep upstarting from their tranquil sleep on neptune broke disturbed he hears and quickened by a monarchs fears his calm broad brow oer ocean rears æneas fleet he sees dispersed whelmed by fierce wave and stormy burst nor failed a brothers eye to read junonian rancour in the deed forthwith he summoned east and west and thus his kingly wrath expressed— how now presume ye on your birth to blend in chaos skies and earth and billowy mountains heavenward heave bold winds without my sovereign leave whom i—but rather were it good to pacify yon troubled flood offend once more and ye shall pay upon a heavier reckoning day back to your master instant flee and tell him not to him but me the imperial trident of the sea ⁠fell by the lots award his is that prisonhouse of stone a mansion eurus all your own there let him lord it to his mind the jailormonarch of the wind ⁠but keep its portal barred ⁠he said and ere his words were done allays the surge brings back the sun triton and swift cymothoe drag the ships from off the pointed crag he tridentarmed each dull weight heaves through the vast shoals a passage cleaves makes smooth the ruffled wave and rides calm oer the surface of the tides as when sedition oft has stirred in some great town the vulgar herd and brands and stones already fly— for rage has weapons always nigh— then should some man of worth appear whose stainless virtue all revere they hush they list his clear voice rules their rebel wills their anger cools so ocean ceased at once to rave when calmly looking oer the wave girt with a range of azure sky the father bids his chariot fly ⁠the tempesttossed æneadæ ⁠strain for the nearest land and turn their vessels from the sea ⁠to libyas welcome strand deep in a bay an island makes ⁠a haven by its jutting sides whereon each wave from ocean breaks ⁠and parting into hollows glides high oer the cove vast rocks extend a beetling cliff at either end beneath their summit far and wide in sheltered silence sleeps the tide while quivering forests crown the scene a theatre of glancing green in front retiring from the wave opes on the view a rockhung cave a home that nymphs might call their own fresh springs and seats of living stone no need of rope or anchors bite to hold the weary vessel tight such haven now æneas gains with seven lorn ships the scant remains ⁠of what was once his fleet forth leap the trojans on the sand lay down their brinedrenched limbs on land ⁠and feel the shore is sweet and first from flints together clashed the latent spark achates flashed caught in sere leaves and deftly nursed till into flame the fuel burst then from the hold the crews oertoiled bring out their grain by ocean spoiled and gird themselves with fire and quern to parch and grind the rescued corn ⁠meanwhile æneas scales a height and sweeps the ocean with his sight might he perchance a capys mark an antheus in his phrygian bark or trace the arms that wont to deck caicus in some labouring wreck no vessel seaward meets his eyes but on the shore three stags he spies close followed by a meaner throng that grazed the winding coasts along he catches from achates hand quiver and bow and takes his stand and first the lordly leaders fall with treelike antlers branching tall then turning on the multitude he drives them routed through the wood nor stays till his victorious bow has laid seven goodly bodies low for his seven ships then portward fares and mid his crews the quarry shares the wine which late their princely host what time they left trinacrias coast bestowed in casks and freely gave a brave mans bounty to the brave with like equality he parts and comforts their desponding hearts comrades and friends for ours is strength ⁠has brooked the test of woes o worsescarred hearts these wounds at length ⁠the gods will heal like those you that have seen grim scylla rave ⁠and heard her monsters yell yon that have looked upon the cave ⁠where savage cyclops dwell come cheer your souls your fears forget this suffering will yield us yet ⁠a pleasant tale to tell through chance through peril lies our way to latium where the fates display a mansion of abiding stay there troy her fallen realm shall raise bear up and live for happier days ⁠such were his words on brow and tongue sat hope while grief his spirit wrung they for their dainty food prepare strip off the hide the carcase bare divide and spit the quivering meat dispose the fire the caldrons heat then stretched on turf their frames refresh with generous wine and wild deers flesh and now when hungers rage was ceased and checked the impatience of the feast in long discourse they strive to track and bring their missing comrades back hope bandies questions with despair if yet they breathe the upper air or down in final durance lie deaf to their friends invoking cry but chief æneas fondly yearns and racks his heart for each by turns now weeping oer orontes grave now claiming lycus from the wave brave gyas and cloanthus brave ⁠and now an end had come when jove his broad view casting from above the countries and their people scanned the sailfledged sea the lowly land last on the summit of the sky paused and on libya fixed his eye twas then sad venus as he mused her starry eyes with tears suffused bespoke him thou whose lightnings awe whose will on heaven and earth is law what has æneas done or how could my poor trojans cloud thy brow to suffer as they suffer now ⁠so many deaths the race has died and now behold them lest one day to italy they win their way ⁠barred from all lands beside once

⁠revolving many a care determines with the dawn of light ⁠forth from the port to fare explore the stranger clime and find what land is his by stress of wind by what inhabitants possessed for waste he sees it man or beast ⁠and back the tidings bear within a hollowed rocks retreat deep in the wood he hides his fleet defended by a leafy screen of forestry and quivering green then with achates moves along wielding two spears steeltipped and strong when in the bosom of the wood before him lo his mother stood in mien and gear a spartan maid or like harpalyce arrayed who tires fleet coursers in the chase and heads the swiftest streams of thrace slung from her shoulders hangs a bow loose to the wind her tresses flow bare was her knee her mantles fold the gathering of a knot controlled and saw ye youths she asks them say one of my sisters here astray a silvan quiver at her side and for a scarf a lynxs hide or pressing on the wild boars track with upraised dart and voiceful pack ⁠thus venus venus son replied no sister we of thine have spied what name to call thee beauteous maid that look that voice the god betrayed can it be phœbus sister bright or some fair nymph has crossed our sight be gracious whosoeer thou art and lift this burden from our heart instruct us neath what sky at last upon what shore our lot is cast we wander here by tempest blown the people and the place unknown o say and many a victims life before thy shrine shall stain my knife ⁠then venus nay i would not claim a goddess venerable name the quiver and the buskins braid but designate a tyrian maid the punic state is this you see agenors tyrian colony but all around the libyans dwell a race in war untamed and fell the sceptre here queen dido sways who fled from tyre in other days to scape a brothers frenzy long and dark the story of her wrong to thread each tangle time would fail so learn the summits of the tale sychæus was her husband once the wealthiest of phœnicias sons she loved him nor her sire denied but made her his a virgin bride but soon there filled the rulers place her brother worst of human race pygmalion twixt the kinsmen came fierce hatred like a withering flame with avarice blind by stealthy blow the monster laid sychæus low een at the altar recking nought what passion in his sister wrought long time he hid the foul offence and feigning many a base pretence beguiled her lovesick innocence but as she slept before her eyes she saw in pallid ghastly guise her lords unburied semblance rise the murderous altar he revealed the deathwound gaping and unhealed and all the crime the house concealed then bids her fly without delay and shows to aid her on her way his buried treasures stores untold of silver and of massy gold she heard and quickened by affright provides

still following where the road shall lead ⁠she turned and flashed upon their view her stately necks purpureal hue ambrosial tresses round her head a more than earthly fragrance shed her falling robe her footprints swept and showed the goddess as she stept while he at length his mother known pursues her with complaining tone and art thou cruel like the rest ⁠why cheat so oft thy sons fond eyes why cannot hand in hand be pressed ⁠and speech exchanged without disguise so ring the words of fond regret while toward the town his face is set but venus either traveller shrouds with thickest panoply of clouds that none may see them touch nor stay nor idly asking breed delay she through the sky to paphos moves and seeks the temple of her loves where from a hundred altars rise rich steam and flowerets odorous sighs ⁠meantime the path itself their clue with speed their journey they pursue and now they climb the hill whose frown on the tall towers looks lowering down and beetles oer the fronting town æneas marvelling views the pile of stately structures huts erewhile marvelling the lofty gates surveys the pavements and the loud highways on press the tyrians each and all some raise aloft the citys

clothe with awe they hollow out the haven they the theatres foundations lay and fashion from the quarrys side tall columns germs of scenic pride so bees when springtime is begun ply their warm labour

the drones that gorge and thieve with toil the busy scene ferments and fragrance breathes from thymy scents o happy they æneas cries as to the roofs he lifts his eyes whose promised walls already rise then enters neath his misty screen and threads the crowd of all unseen ⁠midway within the city stood a spreading grove of hallowed wood the spot where first the punic train fresh from the shock of storm and main the token juno bad foretold dug up the head of charger bold sign of a nation formed for strife and born to years of plenteous life a temple there began to tower to juno rich with many a dower of human wealth and heavenly power ⁠the oblation of the queen brass was the threshold of the gate the posts were sheathed with brazen plate ⁠and brass the valves between first in that spot once more appears a sight to soothe the travellers fears illumes with hope æneas eye and bids him trust his destiny as waiting for the queen he gazed around the fane with eyes upraised much marvelling at a lot so blessed at art by rival hands expressed and labours mastery confessed o wonder there is iliums war and all those battles blazed afar here stands atrides priam here and chafed achilles eithers

pity springs and hearts are touched by human things dismiss your fear we sure may claim to find some safety in our fame he said and feeds his hungry heart with shapes of unsubstantial art in fond remembrance groaning deep while briny floods his visage steep there spreads and broadens on his sight the portraiture of greece in flight pressed by the trojan youth while here troy flies achilles in her rear not far removed with tears he knows the tents of rhesus white as snows through which by sleeps first breath betrayed tydides makes his murderous raid and campward drives the fiery brood of coursers ere on trojan food they browse or drink of xanthus flood here troilus shield and lance let go poor youth achilles illmatched foe fallen backward from the chariot seat whirls on yet clinging by his feet still grasps the reins his hair his neck trail oer the ground in helpless wreck and the loose spear he wont to wield makes dusty scoring on the field meantime to partial pallas fane moved with slow steps a matron train with smitten breasts dishevelled pale beseechingly they bore the veil she motionless as stone remained her cruel eyes to earth enchained thrice to achilles chariot bound

piteous pleading for the dead himself too in the press he knows mixed with the foremost line of foes and swarthy memnon armed for war with followers from the morning star penthesilea leads afield the sisters of the moony shield one naked breast conspicuous shown by looping of her golden zone and burns with all the battles heat a maid the shock of men to meet ⁠while thus with passionate amaze æneas stood in one set gaze queen dido with a warrior train in beautys pride approached the fane as when upon eurotas banks ⁠or cynthus summits high diana leads the oread ranks ⁠in choric revelry girt with her quiver straight and tall though all be gods she towers oer all latonas mild maternal eyes beam with unspoken ecstasies so dido looked so mid the throng with joyous step she moved along as pressing on to antedate the birthday of her nascent state then neath the temples roofing shell on stairs that mount the inner cell throned on a chair of queenly state hemmed round by glittering arms she sate thus circled by religious awe she gives the gathered people law by chancedrawn lot or studious care assigning each his labours share when lo a concourse to the fane he looks amid the shouting train lost antheus and sergestus pressed and brave cloanthus and the rest driven by fierce gales the water oer and landed on a different shore astounded stand twixt fear and joy achates and the chief of troy they burn to hail them and salute but wildering wonder keeps them mute so peering through their cloudy screen they strive the broken tale to glean where rest the vessels and the crew and wherefore thus they come to sue for every ship her chief had sent and clamouring towards the fane they went ⁠then audience granted by the queen ilioneus spoke with placid mien lady whom gracious jove has willed a city in the waste to build and minds of savage temper school by justice humanizing rule we tempesttost on every wave poor trojans your compassion crave from hideous flame our barks to save commiserate our wretched case and war not on a pious race we come not we to spoil and slay your libyan households sweep the prey off to the shore then haste away meek grows the heart by misery cowed and vanquished souls are not so proud a land there is by greece of old known as hesperia rich its mould ⁠its children brave and free œnotrians were its planters fame now gives the race their

sicanias land her mansions ready to our hand and dwell where we were guests so late the subjects of acestes state so spoke ilioneus and the rest with shouts their loud assent expressed ⁠then looking downward dido said discharge you trojans of your dread an infant realm and fortune hard compel me thus my shores to guard who knows not of æneas name of troy her fortune and her fame ⁠and that

monarch too driven hither by the blast like you the great æneas i will send and search the coast from end to end if haply wandering up and down he bide in woodland or in town ⁠in breathless eagerness of joy achates and the chief of troy were yearning long the cloud to burst and thus achates spoke the first what now my chief the thoughts that rise within you see before your eyes ⁠your fleet your friends restored save one who sank beneath the tide een in our presence all beside ⁠confirms your mothers word ⁠scarce had he said the mist gives way and purges brightening into day æneas stood to

delirious fires admires the boy the gifts admires he having hung a little space clasped in æneas warm embrace and satisfied the fond desire of that his counterfeited sire turns him to dido heart and

thymœtes loudly calls to drag the steed within our walls or by suggestion from the foe or troys ill fate had willed it so but capys and the wiser kind surmised the snare that lurked behind to drown it

demonstration bring his hands fast bound a youth unknown across their casual pathway thrown by cunning purpose of his own if so his simulated speech for greece the walls of troy might breach nerved by strong courage to defy the worst and gain his end or die the curious trojans round him flock with rival zeal a foe to mock now listen while my tongue declares the tale you ask of danaan snares and gather from a single charge their catalogue of crimes at large there as he stands confused unarmed like helpless innocence alarmed his wistful eyes on all sides throws and sees that all around are foes what land he cries what sea is left to hold a wretch of country reft driven out from greece while savage troy demands my blood with clamorous joy that anguish put our rage to flight and stayed each hand in act to smite we bid him name and race declare and say why troy her prize should spare then by degrees he laid aside his fear and presently replied ⁠truth gracious king is all i speak and

on that my guiltless kinsmans doom not all in silence—no i swore should fortune bring me home once more my vengeance should redress his fate and speech engendered cankerous hate thence dates my fall ulysses thence still scared me with some fresh pretence with chancedropt words the people fired sought means of hurterrata intrigued conspired nor did the glow of hatred cool till using calchas as his

conflict more o had we done it sea and sky scared us as oft in act to fly but chiefly when completed stood this horse compact of maple wood fierce thunders pealing in our ears proclaimed the turmoil of the spheres perplexed eurypylus we send to question what the fates portend and he from phœbus awful shrine brings back the words of doom divine with blood ye pacified the gales ⁠een with a virgin slain when first ye danaans spread your sails ⁠the shores of troy to gain with blood ye your return must buy a greek must at the altar die that sentence reached the public ear and bred the dull amaze of fear through every heart a shudder ran apollos victim—who the man ulysses turbulent and loud drags calchas forth before the crowd and questions what the immortals mean which way these dubious beckonings lean een then were some discerned my foe and silent watched the coming blow ten days the seer with bated breath restrained the utterance big with death oerborne at last the word agreed he speaks and destines me to bleed all gave a sigh as men set free and hailed the doom content to see the bolt that threatened each alike one solitary victim strike the deathday came the priests prepare salt cakes and fillets for my hair i fled i own it from the knife i broke my bands and ran for life and in a marish lay that night while they should sail if sail they might no longer have i hope ah me my ancient fatherland to see or look on those my eyes desire my darling sons my greyhaired sire perhaps my butchers may requite on their dear heads my traitorous flight and make their wretched lives

country or of kind thou troy remember neer to swerve preserved thyself thy faith preserve if true the story i relate if these my prompt returns be great ⁠the warlike hopes of greece were stayed een from the first on pallas aid but since tydides impious man and foul ulysses born to plan dragged with red hands the sentry slain her fateful image from your fane her chaste locks touched and stained with gore the virgin coronet she wore thenceforth the tide of fortune changed and greece grew weak her queen estranged nor dubious were the signs of ill that showed the goddess altered will the image scarce in camp was set out burst big drops of saltest sweat oer all her limbs her eyes upraised with minatory lightnings blazed and thrice untouched from earth she sprang with quivering spear and bucklers clang back oer the ocean calchas cries we shall not make troys town our prize unless at argos sacred seat our former omens we repeat and bring once more the grace we brought when first these shores our navy sought so now for greece they cross the wave fresh blessings on their arms to crave thence to return so calchas rules unlooked for ere your wonder cools premonished first this frame they planned in your palladiums stead to stand an image for an image given to pacify offended heaven but calchas bade them rear it high with timbers mounting to the sky that none might drag within the gate this new palladium of your state for said he if your hands profaned the gift for pallas self ordained dire havoc—grant ye powers that first that fate be his—on troy should burst but if in glad procession haled by those your hands your walls it scaled then asia should our homes invade and unborn captives mourn the raid such tale of pity aptly feigned our credence for the perjurer gained and tears wrung out from fraudful eyes made us een us a villains prize gainst whom not valiant diomede nor peleus larissæan seed nor ten years fighting could prevail nor navies of a thousand sail ⁠but ghastlier portents lay behind our unprophetic souls to blind laocoon named as neptunes priest was offering up the victim beast when lo from tenedos—i quail een now at telling of the tale— two monstrous serpents stem the tide and shoreward through the stillness glide amid the waves they rear their breasts and toss on high their sanguine crests the hind part coils along the deep and undulates with sinuous sweep the lashed spray echoes now they reach the inland belted by the beach and rolling bloodshot eyes of fire dart their forked tongues and hiss for ire we fly distraught unswerving they toward laocoon hold their way first round his two young sons they wreathe and grind their limbs with savage teeth then as with arms he comes to aid the wretched father they invade and twine in giant folds twice round his stalwart waist their spires are wound twice round his neck while over all their heads and crests tower high and tall he strains his strength their knots to tear while gore and slime his fillets smear and to the unregardful skies sends up his agonizing cries a wounded bull such moaning makes when from his neck the axe he shakes illaimed and from the altar breaks the twin destroyers take their flight to pallas temple on the height there by the goddess feet concealed they lie and nestle neath her shield at once through iliums hapless sons a shock of feverous horror runs all in laocoons deathpangs read the just requital of his deed who dared to harm with impious steel those planks of consecrated deal the image to its fane they cry so soothe the offended deity each in the labour claims his share the walls are breached the town laid bare wheels neath its feet are fixed to glide and round its neck stout ropes are tied so climbs our wall that shape of doom with battle quickening in its womb while youths and maidens sing glad songs and joy to touch the harness thongs it comes and glancing terror down sweeps through the bosom of the town o ilium city of my love o warlike home of powers above four times twas on the threshold stayed four times the armour clashed and brayed yet on we press with passion blind all forethought blotted from our mind till the dread monster we install within the temples towerbuilt wall een then cassandras prescient voice forewarned us of our fatal choice that prescient voice which heaven decreed no son of troy should hear and heed we careless souls the city through with festal boughs the fanes bestrew and in such revelry employ the last last day should shine on troy ⁠meantime heaven shifts from light to gloom and night ascends from oceans womb involving in her shadow broad earth sky and myrmidonian fraud and through the city stretched at will sleep the tired trojans and are still ⁠and now from tenedos set free the greeks are sailing on the sea bound for the shore where erst they lay beneath the still moons friendly ray when in a moment leaps to sight on the kings ship the signal light and

of the gates and introduce their conscious mates ⁠it was the hour when heaven gives rest to weary man the first and best lo as i slept in saddest guise the form of hector seemed to rise full sorrow gushing from his eyes all torn by dragging at the car and black with gory dust of war as once on earth—his swoln feet bored and festering from the inserted cord ah what a sight was there to view how altered from the man we knew our hector who from days long toil comes radiant in achilles spoil or with that red right hand which casts the fires of troy on grecian masts bloodclotted hung his beard and hair and all those many wounds were there which on his gracious person fell around the walls he loved so well methought i first the chief addressed with tears like his and labouring breast o daystar of dardanian land o faithful heart unconquered hand what means this lingering from what shore comes hector to his home once more ah since we saw you many a woe has brought your friends your country low and weary eyes and aching brow are ours that look upon you now what cause has marred that clear calm mien or why those wounds so ghastly green he answers not nor recks him aught of those the idle quests i sought but with a melancholy sigh ah goddessborn he warns me fly escape these flames greece holds the walls proud ilium from her summit falls think not of kings or countrys claims

your fate provide them mansions strong and great the citys walls which heaven has willed beyond the seas you yet shall build he said and from the temple brings dread vesta with her holy things her awful fillets and the fire whose sacred embers neer expire ⁠meantime throughout the city grow the agonies of wildering woe and more and more though deep in shade my fathers palace stood embayed the tumult rises on the ear and clashing armour hurtles fear i start from sleep the roof ascend and with quick heed each noise attend een as while southern winds conspire on standing harvests falls the fire or as a mountain torrent spoils field joyous crop and oxens toils and sweeps whole woods the swain spellbound hears from a rock the unwonted sound o then i saw the tale was true the danaan fraud

those who made this realm divine the town ye aid is wrapt in fire ⁠come—rush we on our fate no safety may the vanquished find till hope of safety be resigned so valour grew to madness then like gaunt wolves rushing from their den whom lawless hungers sullen growl drives forth into the night to prowl the while with jaws all parched and black their famished whelps expect them back amid the volley and the foe with death before our eyes we go on through the town while darkness spreads its hollow covert oer our heads what witness could recount aright the woes the carnage of that night or make his tributary sighs keep measure with our agonies an ancient city topples down from broadbased heights of old renown there in the street confusedly strown lie age and helplessness oerthrown block up the entering of the doors and cumber heavens own templefloors nor only teucrian lives expire sometimes the spark of generous fire revives in vanquished hearts again and danaan victors swell the slain dire

bestir you gallants why so slack see here while others spoil and sack the burning town your tardy feet but now are coming from the fleet he said the vague replies we make reveal at once his dire mistake he sees him fallen among the toils and voice and foot alike recoils as trampling through the thorny brake the heedless traveller stirs a snake and in a sudden fear retires from that fierce head those gathering spires een so androgeos at the sight was shrinking back in palsied fright we mass our arms and close them round surprised and ignorant of the ground their scattered ranks we breathless lay and fortune crowns our first essay flushed with wild joy corœbus cries see fortune beckoning from the skies when she to safety points the way what can we better than obey come change we bucklers and advance each with a grecian cognizance who questions when with foes we deal if craft or courage guides the steel themselves shall give us arms to wield ⁠he speaks and from androgeos tears his plumy helm and figured shield ⁠girds on an argive sword and wears and rhipeus dymas and the rest soon in the newwon spoils are dressed mixed with the greeks we pass unknown neath heavenly favours not our own wage many a combat in the gloom and many a greek send down to doom some seek the vessels and the shore ⁠some smit with fear more low climb the huge horse and hide once more ⁠within the womb they know alas a mortal may not lean on heaven when heaven averts its mien ⁠ah see the priameian fair cassandra by her streaming hair ⁠is dragged from pallas shrine her wild eyes raised to heaven in vain— her eyes alas for cord and chain ⁠her tender hands confine corœbus brooked not such a sight but plunged infuriate in the fight we follow him as blindly rash and forming on the spoilers dash when from the summit of the fane or ere we deem a murderous rain of trojan darts our force oerwhelms misguided by those argive helms then groaning deep their prey to lose the rallied danaans round us

other scenes we flee pelias and iphitus with me this laden with his years and slow that halting from ulysses blow for hark the growing tumult calls for rescue to the palace halls ⁠o there a giant battle raged ⁠who saw it sure had thought no war in troy was elsewhere ragederrata ⁠no deaths beside were wrought so fierce the fray our eyes that met ⁠the danaans streaming to the roof and every gate by foes beset ⁠screened by a penthouse javelinproof close to the walls the ladders cling from step to step the assailants spring een by the doors a shield enfolds their left their right a corbel holds the dardans reckless in despair the turrets and the roofs uptear een to such weapons fortune drives brave patriots struggling for their lives and hurl the gilded beams below the pride of ages long ago while others on the threshold stand and guard the entry sword in hand my heart leaps up the halls to save and help the vanquished to be brave ⁠a secret posterngate was there which oped behind a thoroughfare through priams courts in happier day andromache would pass that way alone to greet the royal pair and lead with her her youthful heir by this the palace roof i gain whence our poor trojans all in vain were showering down their missile rain with sheer descent a turret high rose from the roof into the sky whence curious gazers might look down and see the camp the fleet the town this where the flooring timbers join the stronger stone we undermine and tumble oer it falls along down crashing on the assailant throng but other danaans fill their place and darts and stones still rain apace ⁠full in the gate see pyrrhus blaze a meteor shooting steely rays so flames a serpent into light ⁠on poisonous herbage fed which late in subterranean night ⁠through winter lay as dead now from its ancient weeds undressed ⁠invigorate and young sunward it rears its glittering breast ⁠and darts its threeforked tongue there at his side automedon true liegeman both to sire and son and giant periphas and all the scyrian youth assail the wall ⁠and firebrands roofward dart himself the first with twoedged axe the brazenplated doors attacks ⁠and makes their hinges start now through the heart of oak he drives his weapon and a loophole rives there stands revealed the house within ⁠where the long hall retires the stately privacy is seen ⁠of priam and his sires and on the threshold guards appear in warlike pomp of shield and spear ⁠but far within the palace swarms with tumult and confused alarms the deep courts wail with womens cries the clamour strikes the spangled skies pale matrons run from place to place and clasp the doors in wild embrace strong as his father pyrrhus strains nor bar nor guard his force sustains the hacked door reels neath blow on blow breaks from its hinges and lies low force wins her footing in they rush the danaan hordes the foremost crush and deluge with an armed tide the spacious level far and wide less fierce when breaking from its bounds the water

⁠perhaps you ask of priams fate ⁠he when he sees his town oerthrown greeks bursting through his palacegate ⁠and thronging chambers once his own his ancient armour long laid by ⁠around his palsied shoulders throws girds with a useless sword his thigh ⁠and totters forth to meet his foes within the mansions central space ⁠all bare and open to the day there stood an altar in its place ⁠and close beside an aged bay that drooping oer the altar leaned and with its shade the homegods screened here hecuba and all her train were seeking refuge but in vain huddling like doves by storms dismayed and clinging to the gods for aid but soon as priam caught her sight thus in his youthful armour dight what madness cries she wretched spouse has placed that helmet on your brows say whither fare you times so dire bent knees not lifted arms require could hector now before us stand no help were in my hectors hand take refuge here and learn at length the secret of an old mans strength one altar shall protect us all here bide with us or with us fall she speaks and guides iris trembling feet to join her in the hallowed seat ⁠see fled from murdering pyrrhus runs polites one of priams sons through foes through javelins wounded sore he circles court and corridor while pyrrhus follows in his rear with outstretched hand and levelled spear till just before his parents eyes all bathed in blood he falls and dies with death in view the unchilded sire checked not the utterance of his ire may heaven if heaven be just to heed such horrors render worthy meed he cries for this atrocious deed which makes me see my darling die and stains with blood a fathers eye but he to whom you feign you owe your birth achilles—twas not so he dealt with priam though his foe he feared the laws of right and truth he heard the suppliants prayer with ruth gave hectors body to the tomb and sent me back in safety home so spoke the sire and speaking threw a feeble dart no blood that drew the ringing metal turned it back and left it dangling weak and slack then pyrrhus take the news below and to my sire achilles go tell him of his degenerate seed and that and this my bloody deed now die and to the altarstone ⁠along the marble floor he dragged the father sliddering on ⁠een in his childs own gore his left hand in his hair he wreathed ⁠while with the right he plied his flashing sword and hiltdeep sheathed ⁠within the old mans side so priams fortunes closed at last so passed he seeing as he passed his troy in flames his royal tower laid low in dust by hostile power who once oer land and peoples proud sat while before him asia bowed now on the shore behold him dead a nameless trunk a trunkless head ⁠o then i felt as neer before chill horror to my bosoms core i seemed my aged sire to see beholding priam old as he grasp out his life before my eyes forlorn creusa seemed to rise our palace sacked and desolate and young iulus left to fate then looking round the place i eyed to see who yet were at my side some by the flames were swallowed some had leapt to earth the end was come ⁠i stood alone when lo i mark in vestas temple crouching dark the traitress helen the broad blaze gives me full light as round i gaze she shrinking from the trojans hate made frantic by their citys fate nor dreading less the danaan sword the vengeance of her injured lord— she troys and argos common fiend sat cowering by the altar screened my blood was fired fierce passion woke to quit troys fall by one sure stroke what to mycenæ shall she go a conqueress in a pageant show see home sire children spouse again with phygian menials in her train good priam slaughtered troy no more the dardan plains afloat with gore no—though no glory be to gain from vengeance on a woman taen yet he that rids the world of guilt may claim the praise of blood well spilt twere joy to satiate righteous ire and slake my countrys funeral fire thus was i raving past control in aimless turbulence of soul when sudden dawning on the night neer had i known her face so bright my mother flashed upon my sight confessed a goddess with the mien and stature that in heaven are seen reproachfully my hand she pressed and thus from roseate lips addressed my son what cruel wrongs excite your wrath to such pernicious height what mean you by this madness where left you that love to me you bear and will you not at least inquire what fate betides your timeworn sire if your creusa still survive if young ascanius be alive all these are trembling as for life with grecian bands around them rife and but for me had sunk oerpowered by flame or by the sword devoured not the loathed charms of spartas dame nor paris victim of your blame— no tis the gods the gods destroy this mighty realm and pull down troy behold for i will purge the haze that darkles round your mortal gaze and blunts its keenness—mark me still nor disobey your mothers will— here where you see huge blocks unfixed and dust and smoke in whirlwind mixed great neptune with his threeforked mace upheaves the ramparts from their place and rocks the town from cope to base here juno at the scæan gates begirt with steel impatient waits and clamorous from the navy calls her comrades to the captured walls look back—see pallas oer the tower with cloud and gorgon redly lower een jove to greece his strength affords and fights from heaven gainst dardan swords then fly and give the struggle oer myself will guard you till once more you stand before your fathers door she spoke and vanished from my sight lost in the darkness of the night dire presences their forms disclose and powers of terror iliums foes ⁠that vision showed me neptunes town in blazing ruin sinking down as rustics strive with many a stroke to fell some venerable oak it still keeps nodding to its doom still bows its head and shakes its plume till by degrees oercome one groan it heaves and on the hill lies prone down from my perilous height i glide safe sheltered by my heavenly guide so thread my way through foes and fire the darts give place the flames retire ⁠but when i gained anchises door and stood within my home once more my sire whom i had hoped to bear safe to the hills with chiefest care refused to lengthen out his span and live on earth an exiled man you you he cries bestir your flight whose blood is warm whose limbs are light had heaven not willed my life to cease heaven would have kept my home in peace enough that i have once been saved survivor of a town enslaved now leave me be your farewell said to this my corpse and count me dead my hand shall win me death the foe such mercy as i need will show will strip my spoils and pass for brave he lacks not much that lacks a grave long have i lived to curse my birth a useless cumberer of the earth een from the day when heavens dread sire in anger scathed me with his fire ⁠so talked he obstinately set while we our eyes with sorrow wet all on our knees wife husband boy implore—o let him not destroy himself and us nor lend his weight to the incumbent load of fate he hears not but refuses still unchanged alike in place and will desperate again to arms i fly and make my wretched choice to die for what deliverance now was mine what help in fortune or design what leave my sire behind and flee such words from you such words to me the watch that guards a parents lip lets it such dire suggestion slip if heaven in truth has willed to spare no relic of a town so fair if you and all wherein you joy must burn to feed the flames of troy see there death waits you at the door see pyrrhus steeped in priams gore repeats his double crime once more the son before his fathers eyes the father at the altar dies o mother was it then for this i passed where fires and javelins hiss safe in thy conduct but to see foes in my homes dear sanctuary— all murdered father wife and child each in the others blood defiled my arms my arms the fatal day calls and the vanquished must obey return me to the danaan crew let me the yielded fight renew no one at least these walls contain who will not unavenged be slain ⁠once more i gird me for the field and to my arm make fast my shield and issue from the door—when see creusa clings around my knee and offers with a tender grace iulus to his sires embrace if but to perish forth you fare take us with you your fate to share but if you hope that help may come from sword and shield first guard your home think think to whom you leave your child your sire and her whom bride you styled so cried she and the tearful sound was filling all the chambers round when sudden in the house we saw a sight for wonderment and awe between us while iulus stands mid weeping eyes and clasping hands lo from the summit of his head a lambent flame was seen to spread sport with his locks in harmless play and grazing round his temples stray we hurrying strive his hair to quench and the blest flame with water drench but sire anchises to the skies in rapture lifts voice hands and eyes vouchsafe this once almighty jove if prayer thy righteous will can move and if our care have earned us thine give aid and ratify this sign scarce had the old man said when hark it thundered left and through the dark a meteor with a train of light athwart the sky gleamed dazzling bright right oer our palaceroof it crossed then in idæan woods was lost still glittering on a fiery trail succeeds and sulphurous fumes exhale at this my sire his form uprears salutes the gods the star reveres lead on blest sign no more i crave gods save my house my grandchild save you sent this augury of joy where you are present there is troy i yield i yield nor longer shun to share the exile of my son ⁠he ceased and near and yet more near the loud flame strikes on eye and ear come mount my shoulders dear my sire such load my strength shall never tire now whether fortune smiles or lowers one risk one safety shall be ours my son shall journey at my side my wife her steps by mine shall guide at distance safe what next i say attend my servants and obey without the city stands a mound with ceres ruined temple crowned a cypress spreads its branches near hoar with hereditary fear part we our several ways to meet at length beside that hallowed seat you father in your arms upbear troys household gods with duteous care for me just scaped from battlefray on holy things a hand to lay were desecration till i lave my body in the running wave so saying in a lions hide i robe my shoulders mantling wide ⁠and stoop beneath the precious load iulus fastens to my side his steps scarce matching with my stride ⁠my wife behind me takes her road we travel darkling in the shade ⁠and i whom through that fearful night nor volleyed javelins had dismayed ⁠nor foemen hand to hand in fight now start at every sound in dread for him i bore and him i led ⁠and now the gates i neared at last and all the journey seemed oerpast ⁠when trampling feet my ear assail my father peering through the gloom cries haste my son o haste they come ⁠i see their shields their glittering mail twas then alas some power unkind bereft me of my wildered mind while unfrequented paths i thread and shun the roads that others tread my wife creusa—did she stray or halt exhausted by the way i know not—parted from our train nor ever crossed our sight again nor eer my eyes her figure sought nor eer towards her turned my thought till when at ceres hallowed spot we mustered she alone was not and her companions spouse and son looked round and saw themselves undone ah that sad hour whom spared i then in my wild grief of gods and men what woe in all the town oerthrown thought i more cruel than my own my father and my darling boy and last not least the gods of troy to my retainers i confide and in the winding valley hide while to the town once more i go and shining armour round me throw resolved through troy to measure back from end to enderrata my perilous track ⁠first to the citys shadowed gate i turn me whence we passed so late my footsteps through the darkness trace and cast my eyes from place to place a shuddering on my spirit falls and een the silence self appals then to my palace i repair in hope in hope to find her there in vain the foes had forced the door and flooded all the mansion oer fanned by the wind the flame upsoars roofhigh the hot blast skyward roars departing thence i seek the tower the ruined seat of priams power there phœnix and ulysses fell in the void courts by junos cell ⁠were set the spoil to keep snatched from the burning shrines away there iliums mighty treasure lay rich altars bowls of massy gold and captive raiment rudely rolled ⁠in one promiscuous heap while boys and matrons wild with fear in long array were standing near with desperate daring i essayed to send my voice along the shade roused the still streets and called in vain creusa oer and oer again thus while in agony i pressed from house to house the endless quest the pale sad spectre of my wife confronts me larger than in life i stood appalld my hair erect and fear my tonguetied utterance checked while gently she her speech addressed and set my troubled heart at rest why grieve so madly husband mine nought here has chanced without design fate and the sire of all decree creusa shall not cross the sea long years of exile must be yours vast seas must tire your labouring oars at length hesperia you shall gain where through a rich and peopled plain ⁠soft tiber rolls his tide there a new realm a royal wife shall build again your shattered life weep not your dear creusas fate neer through mycenæs haughty gate ⁠a captive shall i ride nor swell some grecian matrons train i born of dardan princes strain ⁠to venus seed allied heavens mighty mother keeps me here farewell and hold our offspring dear then while i dewed with tears my cheek and strove a thousand things to speak ⁠she melted into night thrice i essayed her neck to clasp thrice the vain semblance mocked my grasp ⁠as wind or slumber light so now the long long night oerpast i reach my weary friends at last there with amazement i behold newmustering comrades young and old sons mothers bound from home to flee a melancholy company they meet prepared to brave the seas and sail with me whereer i please now rising oer the heights of ide shone the bright star days orient guide the danaans swarmed at every door nor seemed there hope of safety more i yield to fate take up my sire and to the mountains shade retire when harsh omnipotence had brought the power of asias kings to nought when troys neptunian walls became a prostrate mass of smouldring flame to diverse exile we are driven in desert lands by signs from heaven there in antandros under ide the wishedfor vessels we provide unknowing whither fate may lead or what the settlement decreed and call our forces round the sun his summer course had scarce begun when now my sire anchises gave his voice to tempt the fated wave weeping i quit the port the shore the plains where ilium stood before and homeless launch upon the main son friends and homegods in my train ⁠a realm lies near of ample space lycurgus ruled it once called thrace allied of old to iliums powers its homegods federate with ours while fate was with us here i land and here along the winding strand trace out alas neath fortunes frown the first beginnings of a town and from myself as founder call æneadæ the rising wall ⁠to my bright mothers power divine ⁠and all the tenants of the skies so might they speed my new design ⁠i was performing sacrifice and on the shore to heavens high king a snowwhite bull was slaughtering a mound was nigh where spearlike wood of cornel and of myrtle stood i sought it and began to spoil of that thick growth the highheaped soil and deck the altars with its green when lo a ghastly sight was seen soon as a tree from earth i rend darkflowing drops of blood descend ⁠and stain the ground with gore fear shakes my frame from head to foot a second sapling i uproot resolved to pierce the mystery dark see trickling from a second bark ⁠blood follows as before with many a tumult in my soul ⁠i prayed the dryads of the place and king gradivus whose control ⁠is felt through all the fields of thrace that they would meliorate the sight and make this heavy omen light but when the third tall shaft i seize and gainst the hillock press my knees— ⁠speak shall i or be mute— een from the bottom of the mound is heard a lamentable sound why thus my frame æneas rend respect at length a buried friend ⁠nor those pure hands pollute trojan not alien is the blood that oozes from the uptorn wood fly this fell soil these greedy shores the voice you hear is polydores from my gored breast a growth of spears its murderous vegetation rears i heard fearstricken and amazed my speech tonguetied my hair upraised this polydore erewhile by stealth with store of delegated wealth unhappy priam in despair sent to the thracian monarchs care when first troy felt her prowess fail encompassed by the leaguering pale there when our star its light withdraws false to divine and human laws the traitor joins the conquerors cause lays impious hands on polydore and grasps by force the golden store fell lust of gold abhorred accurst what will not men to slake such thirst soon as my blood regains its heat the direful portent i repeat to troys chief lords and first my sire and then collective voice enquire all vote to fly from friendships grave quit the curst soil and cross the wave so then to polydore we pay new rites and heap his mound with clay raised to the dead two altars stand with cypress wreathed and woollen band around them trojan matrons go their hair unbound in sign of woe bowls frothing warm with milk we pour and cups of sacrificial gore lay in the tomb the ghost to sleep and thrice invoke it loud and deep ⁠then soon as man may trust the seas invited by the crisp spring breeze my comrades drag along the sand the welldried ships and crowd the strand so from the harbour forth we sail and land and town in distance fail encircled by a billowy ring ⁠a land there lies the loved resort of neptune the ægæan king ⁠and the grey queen of nereus court long time the sport of evry blast ⁠oer ocean it was wont to toss till grateful phœbus moored it fast ⁠to gyaros and high myconos and bade it lie unmoved and brave the violence of wind and wave that port all peace receives our fleet we land and hail apollos seat king anius king and priest in one ⁠with baycrowned tresses hoar hastes to accost us and is known ⁠anchises friend of yore we grasp his friendly hand in proof of welcome and approach his roof the sacred temple i adored ⁠of immemorial stone o grant us thymbras gracious lord ⁠a mansion of our own grant us a sure abiding place a habitation and a race save our new troy the relics these of achillean cruelties what guide to follow what our goal speak father and inspire our soul scarce had i said a trembling takes ⁠the sacred courts the bays divine the mountain to its centre shakes ⁠the tripod echoes from the shrine prone as we fall with reverent fear a heavenly utterance strikes our ear stout dardan hearts the realm of earth where first your nation sprang to birth that realm shall now receive you back go seek your ancient mothers track there shall æneas house renewed for ages rule a world subdued thus phœbus and bewildered joy ran murmuring through the ranks of troy each asking what the city walls whereto the god his wanderers calls at this my sire revolving oer the bygone memories of yore hear noble chiefs and learn cries he the place of your expectancy in ocean lies joves island crete where ida stands our nations seat a hundred cities crown the isle and the broad fields with plenty smile thence teucer our great sire of yore took ship for the rhœtean shore ⁠if right i mind my tale and chose his kingdom ilium then not yet had risen the tribes of men ⁠dwelt in the lowly vale thence cybeles majestic dame and corybantian cymbals came thence idas grove and mystic awe and lions trained her car to draw come then let heaven direct our feet appease the winds and sail for crete it lies not far be jove at hand the third days sun shall see us land he spoke and rendering each his due the victims at the altars slew a bull to neptune and a bull ⁠to thee apollo bright a lamb to tempest black of wool ⁠to western winds a white ⁠idomeneus we hear has flown ⁠driven from his home in cretan land fame tells us of an empty throne ⁠and mansions ready to our hand ortygia left we skim the deeps by naxos bacchanalian steeps olearos and donysa green and parian cliffs of dazzling sheen pass cyclad isles oer ocean strown and seas with many a land thick sown the rowers sing merrily as we go for crete and our forefathers ho fair winds escort us oer the tide and soon neath cretan coasts we glide ⁠the site determined i lay down the groundwork of my infant town ⁠its name pergamia call and bid the nation proud to own that title guard their loved hearthstone ⁠and raise the fortress wall high on the beach their ships they draw ⁠then take them wives and till the land ⁠the while with equitable hand i portion dwellingplace and law when sudden on mans feeble frame from tainted skies a sickness came on trees and crops a poisonous breath a year of pestilence and death their pleasant lives the sufferers yield ⁠or drag their languid limbs with pain the dogstar burns the grassy field ⁠and sickening crops withhold the grain back to ortygias shrine my sire ⁠oer ocean bids us go there sue for favour and enquire ⁠the limit of our woe what succour weary souls should try and whither if we must to fly ⁠twas night all life in sleep was laid ⁠when lo our household gods the same ⁠whom through the midmost of the flame from falling ilium i conveyed appeared before me while i lay in slumber bright as if in day where through the inserted window stream the glories of the full moonbeam then thus their gentle speech addressed and set my troubled heart at rest the word that phœbus has to speak should you his delian presence seek he of his unsought bounty sends een by the mouth of us your friends we who have followed yours and you ⁠since ilium was no more we who have sailed among your crew ⁠the swelling billows oer your seed as demigods will crown and make them an imperial town build you the walls decreed by fate and let them like ourselves be great nor shrink how long soeer it be from this your wandering oer the sea change we our dwelling not to crete apollo called your truant feet there is a land by greece of old surnamed hesperia rich its mould ⁠its children brave and free œnotrians were its settlers fame now gives the race its leaders name ⁠and calls it italy here dardanus was born our king and old iasius whence we spring ⁠here our authentic seat rise tell your sire without delay our sentence which let none gainsay search till you find the ausonian land and old cortona jove has banned ⁠your settlement in crete amazed by wonders heard and seen ⁠for twas no dream that mocked my eyes ⁠no—plain i seemed to recognize their cinctured locks their wellknown mien while at the sight chill clammy sweat burst forth and all my limbs were wet that instant from my couch i rise with voice and hands implore the skies and offer at the household shrine full cups of unadulterate wine my worship ended glad of soul i seek my sire and tell the whole at once he owns the ambiguous race the rival sires to whom we trace and smiles that ancient lands have wrought such new confusion in his thought then cries my son the slave too long ⁠of ilian destiny one voice aforetime sang that song ⁠cassandra—none but she such fate she said i mind it all ⁠was for our race in store and oft on italy would call ⁠oft on the hesperian shore but who could think that trojans born ⁠hesperia eer would reach or who that heard that maid forlorn ⁠gave credence to her speech yield we to phœbus and pursue admonished thus a course more true he ceased and our applauding crew ⁠obeys him all and each so now this second home resigned to the scant few we leave behind we set our sails once more and sweep along the illimitable deep ⁠the fleet had passed into the main ⁠and land no longer met the eye on every side the watery plain ⁠on every side the expanse of sky when oer my head a cloud there stood ⁠with night and tempest in its womb and all the surface of the flood ⁠was ruffled by the incumbent gloom at once the winds huge billows roll the gathering waters climb the pole ⁠we scatter tossing oer the deep the thunderclouds involve the day dark night has snatched the heaven away ⁠through rents of sky the lightnings leap thus erring from our track designed we grope among the waters blind een palinurus cannot trace ⁠the boundary line of day and night ⁠or recollect his course aright amid the undistinguished space three starless nights three sunless days we welter in the blinding haze the fourth at last the prospect clears and smoke from distant hills appears drop sails ply oars the labouring crew toss wide the foam and brush the blue ⁠scaped from the fury of the seas we land upon the strophades ⁠such name in greece they bear isles in the vast ionian main where fell celæno and her train ⁠of harpies hold their lair since driven from phineus door they fled the tables where of old they fed so foul a plague for human crime neer issued from the stygian slime a maid above a bird below noisome and foul the bellys flow the hands are taloned famine bleak sits ever ghastly on the cheek soon as we gain the port we see sleek heads of oxen pasturing free and goats without a swain to guard dispersed along the grassy sward we seize our weapons lay them dead ⁠and call on jove the spoil to share then on the winding beach we spread ⁠our couches and enjoy the fare when sudden from the mountains swoop fierce charging down the harpy troop devour contaminate befoul with sickening stench and hideous howl a second time we take our seat deep in a hollowed rocks retreat protected by a leafy screen of forestry and quivering green there spread the tables skin the flesh and light our altarfires afresh a second time the assailants fly from other regions of the sky with crooked claws the banquet waste and poison whatsoeer they taste i charge my crews to draw the sword and battle with the fiendish horde they act as bidden and conceal along the grass the glittering steel so when the rush of wings once more is heard along the bending shore misenus sounds his loud alarms from the hills top and calls to arms and on we rush in novel war these foul seabirds to maim and mar in vain no weapons stroke may cleave ⁠the texture of their feathery mail they soar into the air and leave ⁠on food halfgnawn their loathsome trail all but celæno she curst seer speaks from a rock these words of fear what would ye fight false perjured race ⁠fight for the beeves your greed has slain and unoffending harpies chase ⁠from their hereditary reign now listen and attentive lay deep in your hearts the things i say the fate by jove to phœbus shown by phœbus self to me made known— aye tremble for in me ye view the furies queen—i tell to you to italy in haste ye drive ⁠with winds at your command go then in italy arrive ⁠and draw your ships to land but ere your town with walls ye fence ⁠fierce famine retribution dread for this your murderous violence ⁠shall make you eat your boards for bread she spoke and vanished mid the wood chill horror froze my comrades blood no more of arms the prayer the vow they fain would make their weapons now whateer the monsters powers divine or birds illomened and malign with outstretched hands my father prays the gods above and offerings pays heaven bar these threatenings heaven avert such horror and protect desert then bids the crews their ships unbind and stretch the mainsheet to the wind ⁠the south wind freshens in the sail ⁠we hurry oer the tide whereer the helmsman and the gale ⁠conspire our course to guide now rises oer the foamy flood zacynthos with its crown of wood dulichium same neritos whose rocky sides the waves emboss the crags of ithaca we flee laertes rugged sovereignty nor in our flight forget to curse the land that was ulysses nurse soon leucas rears its cloudcapped head and phœbus whom the seamen dread hither we turn our barks at last ⁠and near his city land the anchors from the prows are cast ⁠the keels are on the strand ⁠so given awhile on land to stay our lustral rites to jove we pay ⁠and light the votive flames and make the shores of actium gay ⁠with iliums festal games with pride my merry comrades strip and oil them for the wrestlers grip ⁠true to the wont of troy so many argive towns oerpast and flight mid circling foes held fast ⁠o but the thought was joy meantime the sun rolls round the year and winter makes the waters drear the brazen circle of a shield which mighty abas wont to wield i fasten to the templegate and thus my deed commemorate æneas fixes on these doors arms won from danaan conquerors then give my crews the word to quit the port and on their benches sit with emulous zeal they smite the deep and oer the wavy level sweep phæacias heights from view we hide ⁠and coast along epirot lands then in chaonias arbour ride ⁠nigh where buthrotums city stands ⁠arrived i hear a wondrous thing ⁠a grecian crown on trojan brows they tell me helenus is king ⁠of pyrrhus realm with pyrrhus spouse and sad andromache restored once more to a compatriot lord at once i burn with strong desire to greet them and the tale enquire so from the port i take my way and leave my vessels in the bay it chanced andromache that day there in a grove without the wall ⁠beside a mimic simois wave was making funeral festival ⁠at hectors counterfeited grave raised by her hands a grassy heap with altars twain whereat to weep when as she saw my near advance and marked our trojan cognizance awhile distracted and amazed she stood and stiffened as she gazed ⁠the lifeblood leaves her cheeks she faints at last from earth upraised ⁠in faltering tones she speaks real is it real the face i view a harbinger of tidings true say are you living or if dead then where is hector so she said and tears in copious torrent shed ⁠and filled the air with cries thus as her tide of passion flows few broken words i interpose aye i am living living still through all extremity of ill ⁠no dream your sense belies but say alas what new estate receives you fallen from such a mate what fortune matches the degree of hectors own andromache still wear you pyrrhus nuptial yoke she dropped her voice and softly spoke ⁠with lowly downcast eyes o happy more than all beside ⁠the priameian maid who for her dead foes pleasure died ⁠beneath her citys shade not drawn for servitude nor led a captive to a conquerors bed while we our country laid in dust ⁠to exile dragged oer many a wave have stooped to pyrrhus haughty lust ⁠his infants mother and his slave a spartan marriage tempts the youth he plights hermione his truth cast off to helenus i fall so wills our master thrall to thrall but soon orestes mad with crime ⁠and wroth to lose his promised bride smote pyrrhus in unguarded time ⁠and at the altarfire he died on helenus the tyrant slain devolves a portion of his reign who calls the realm beneath his hand from chaons name chaonian land and crowns the hill in sign of power with pergamus our dardan tower but you—what destiny from heaven what stress of wind your bark has driven ⁠unknowing on our coast and lives he yet whom once at troy— ascanius dwells there in the boy ⁠grief for his mother lost feels he the hereditary flame ⁠his growing spirit fire at hectors and æneas name ⁠his uncle and his sire so poured she her impassioned wail still weeping on without avail when girt with royal retinue king helenus appears in view acknowledges his friends of troy and leads us to his home with joy and as our fainting hearts he cheers with words of welcome mixes tears i see a mimic trojan state a pergamus that apes the great a driedup xanthus channel trace and other scæan gates embrace nor less my trojan comrades share the monarchs hospitable care in spacious cloisters entertained neath the halls roof the wine they drained and goblets for libation hold while the rich banquet gleams in gold ⁠two days had passed the favouring gale invites the fleet and swells the sail bent on departure i accost with words like these our sacred host true son of troy whose heaventaught skill perceives the signs of phœbus will the tripods and the clarian bays the secret of nights starry maze and birds their voices and their ways speak—for the accordant sense of heaven fair presage for my course has given each god has charged me to explore in faroff seas italias shore celænos harpy voice alone makes prodigies and vengeance known and famines foulest horror—say what perils first beset my way what counsel following may i cope with toils so great in manful hope then helenus with slaughtered kine appeases first the powers divine ⁠the fillets from his head unbinds and to apollos fane conducts me while in every vein ⁠i feel the presence dread and thus from his prophetic tongue the message of the future rung o goddessborn—for broad and clear the augury of your proud career so lie the lots in joves dark urn so the dread three their spindles turn— now listen while to give you ease in wandering oer yon stranger seas and help you to the port you seek a fragment of your fate i speak unknown to helenus the rest or juno locks it in his breast learn first that italy which seems so near you grasp it in your dreams and think to anchor in its bay as though withinyour ken it lay a pathless path oer leagues of foam divides from this our distant home first in trinacrian water plied your oar must tug against the tide first must your weary galleys keep long vigils on the ausonian deep must pass the lurid lake of ghosts and skirt ææan circes coasts ere free from danger you may found your city on the destined ground now hear the tokens i impart and store them up within your heart when as you roam in anxious mood beside a still sequestered flood neath fringing holms before your eye a thirtyfarrowed sow shall lie her white length stretching oer the ground her young as white her teats around that spot shall see the promised town shall see troys heavy load laid down nor shudder at the doom of dread that tells of eating boards for bread fate in her time shall find a way and phœbus waits on souls that pray but for italias neighbour shore on whose near beach our billows roar avoid it there in every place has settled argos hated race here locrian tribes from naryx come have found them an italian home here oer salentums conquered plains idomeneus the cretan reigns while here petilias tiny tower is manned by philoctetes power nay when upon italian land transported oer the main you stand and pay your offerings on the strand ere yet you light your altars spread a purple covering oer your head lest sudden bursting on your sight some hostile presence mar the rite thus worship you and thus your train and sons unborn the rite retain but when sicilias shore you near and dim pelorns strait grows clear seek the south coast though long the run to make its round the northern shun these lands they say by rupture strange so much can times dark process change were cleft in sunder long agone when erst the twain had been but one between them rushed the deep and rent the island from the continent and now with interfusing tides twixt severed lands and cities glides there scylla guards the righthand coast the left is fell charybdis post thrice from the lowest gulf she draws the water down her giant jaws thrice sends it foaming back to day and deluges the heaven with spray but scylla crouches in the gloom deep in a caverns monstrous womb thence darts her ravening mouth and drags the helpless vessels on the crags above she shows a human face and breasts resembling maiden grace below tis all a hideous whale wolfs belly linked to dolphins tail far better past pachynus cape your journeys tedious circuit shape than catch one glimpse of scyllas cell and hear those grisly hellhounds yell and now if helenus speak sooth if phœbus fill his soul with truth one charge one sovereign charge i press and stamp it with reiterate stress deep in your memory first of all on juno mighty juno call pay vows to juno overbear her queenly soul with gift and prayer so wafted oer trinacrias main italia you at length shall gain there when you land at cumæs town where forests oer avernus frown your eyes shall see the frenzied maid who spells the future in the shade of her deep cavern and consigns to scattered leaves her mystic lines these when the words of fate are traced she leaves within her cavern placed awhile they rest in order ranged the sequence and the place unchanged but should the breeze through chanceoped door whirl them in air twixt roof and floor she lets them flutter nor takes pain to set them in their rank again the pilgrims unresolved return and her prophetic threshold spurn so do not you nor count too dear the hours you lavish on the seer but though your comrades chide your stay and breezes whisper hence away approach her humbly and entreat herself the presage to repeat and open of her own free choice the prisoned flow of tongue and voice the martial tribes of italy the story of your wars to be and how to face or how to fly each cloud that darkens on your sky her lips shall tell and with success the remnant of your journey bless thus far may run these words of mine go on and make our troy divine ⁠so spoke the seer and as he ends rich presents to my vessel sends carved ivory and massy gold and silver stores he in the hold and caldrons of dodonas mould a hauberk twined of golden chain a helm adorned with flowing mane which pyrrhus wore nor lacks my sire due bounty matching his desire he finds us horses finds us guides and oars and equipage provides meantime anchises bids to sail nor longer cheat the expectant gale and thus apollos seer addressed in courteous phrase his ancient guest great chief fair venus honoured mate twice saved by heaven from iliums fate see there ausonias coast at hand ⁠before your fleet it lies approach but think not there to rest no skirt it and pursue your quest far distant that ausonian land ⁠which phœbus signifies pass on in peace he cries pass on blest in the affection of your son why task your patience or delay the wind fair blowing from the bay andromache as loth to part displays the trophies of her art and robes ascanius in the fold of phrygian mantle wrought with gold nor stints her hand but from the store brings broidered vestments more and more nay take these too and let them prove a fond memorial of the love ⁠of hectors sometime wife dear child of troy in whom alone astyanax my lost my own ⁠survives in second life like yours his hands like yours his brow ⁠like yours his eyes bright sheen and oh he might be growing now ⁠in years as fresh and green ⁠hot teardrops in my eyelids swell as thus i speak my last farewell live and be blest tis sweet to feel fates book is closed and under seal for us alas that volume stern has many another page to turn yours is a rest assured no more of ocean wave to task the oar no far ausonia to pursue still flying flying from the view a mimic xanthus and a troy framed by yourselves your thoughts employ born grant it heaven in happier day nor offering greece so sure a prey if tibers bank tis mine to see and build the walls my fates decree then shall these kindred towns and towers epirot yours hesperian ours sprung from one father long ago and partners in a common woe be knit together heart and soul in one fair troy one patriot whole such be the legacy we leave such bond for sons unborn to weave ⁠away we speed along the sea ⁠beneath ceraunian steeps where lies the way to italy ⁠the shortest oer the deeps the sun comes down and every height is darkened by advancing night on earth we stretch us by the tide his several oar at each ones side then take our cheer and slumberous dews descend upon our weary crews night had not climbed heavens topmost steep when palinurus starts from sleep observes each wind with anxious care and questions all that stirs in air each star that roams the etherial plain ⁠his eye has noted and explored arcturus hyads and the wain ⁠and bright orions golden sword he sees all calm without a cloud then from the stern he signals loud we shift our camp attempt the way and to the breeze our vans display now the red morning from the sky ⁠had chased the starry host when from afar dim hills we spy ⁠italias lowly coast italia cries achates first italia peals the joyous burst ⁠of welcome from each crew my sire anchises wreathes with flowers a brimming cup and calls the powers ⁠full on the stern in view gods of the sea the land the air waft our smooth course with breezes fair the winds blow freshly oer the sky the port grows wider to the eye and on the cliff in prospect plain is seen minervas hallowed fane my comrades furl their sails and stand still rowing onward for the land the port is hollowed in a bay concealed by crags that lashed with spray ⁠confront the billows roar on each side runs a rocky line with arm extended and the shrine ⁠moves backward from the shore first token of our fate we see four snowwhite horses pasturing free war is thy portance stranger soil war cries my sire the chargers toil ⁠tis war these grazers threat yet may een such one day submit to bear the yoke and champ the bit ⁠aye peace may bless us yet then martial pallas we adore the first who welcomes us to shore and standing at the altars spread a phrygian covering oer our head and mindful of the great command ⁠by helenus expressly given we burn the oblations of our hand ⁠to argive juno queen of heaven ⁠our vows all paid again to sea ⁠we turn the vessels head and leave the grecian colony ⁠the land of doubt and dread thy bay tarentum next we view herculean town if fame say true against it on the steep is seen laciniums venerable queen and lofty caulons towers appear and scylaceum sailors fear then distant darkening on the sky trinacrian ætna meets the eye we hear the seas stupendous roar and broken voices on the shore the waters from the deep upboil and surf and sand the depth turmoil charybdis cries my sire behold the rocks that helenus foretold haste haste my friends together ply your oars and from destruction fly so said so done each heeds and hears first palinure to southward steers and southward southward all the rest with sail and oar their flight addressed now to the sky mounts up the ship now to the very shades we dip thrice in the depth we feel the shock of billows thundering on the rock thrice see the spray upheaved in mist and dewy stars by foamdrops kissed at last bereft of wind and sun upon the cyclops shore we run ⁠the port is sheltered from the blast its compass unconfined and vast but ætna with her voice of fear in weltering chaos thunders near now pitchy clouds she belches forth of cinders red and vapour swarth and from her caverns lifts on high live balls of flame that lick the sky now with more dire convulsion flings disploded rocks her hearts rent strings and lava torrents hurls to day a burning gulf of fiery spray tis said enceladus huge frame heartstricken by the avenging flame is prisoned here and underneath gasps through each vent his sulphurous breath and still as his tired side shifts round trinacria echoes to the sound through all its length while clouds of smoke the living soul of ether choke all night by forest branches screened we writhe as neath some torturing fiend ⁠nor know the horrors cause for stars were none nor welkin bright with heavenly fires but blank black night ⁠the stormy moon withdraws ⁠and now the daystar tricked anew had drawn from heaven the veil of dew when from the wood all ghastly wan a stranger form resembling man comes running forth and takes its way with suppliant gesture to the bay we turn and look on limbs besmeared with direst filth a length of beard ⁠a dress with thorns held tight in all beside a greek his style who in his countrys arms erewhile ⁠had sailed at troy to fight soon as our dardan arms he saw brief space he stood in wildering awe and checked his speed then toward the shore with cries and weeping onward bore by heaven and heavens blest powers i pray and lifes pure breath this light of day receive me trojans oer the seas transport mo wheresoeer you please i ask no farther aye tis true i once was of the danaan crew ⁠and levied war on troy if all too deep that crimes red stain then fling me piecemeal to the main ⁠and mid the waves destroy if death is certain let me die by hands that share humanity he ended and before us flung about our knees in suppliance clung his name his race we bid him show and what the story of his woe anchises self his hands extends and bids the trembler count us friends then by degrees he laid aside his fear and presently replied ⁠from ithaca my home i came and achemenides my name ⁠the comrade of ulysses woes for troy i left my fathers door poor adamastus—both were poor— ⁠ah would these fates had been as those me in their eager haste to fly the scene of hideous butchery my unreflecting countrymen left in the cyclops savage den all foul with gore that banquetroom immense and dreadful in its gloom he lofty towering strikes the skies snatch him ye gods from mortal eyes no kindly look eer crossed his face neer oped his lips in courteous grace the limbs of wretches are his food he champs their flesh and quaffs their blood i saw when his enormous hand plucked forth two victims from our band swung round and on the threshold dashed while all the floor with blood was splashed i saw him grind them bleeding fresh and close his teeth on quivering flesh not unrequited such a wrong my wily chieftain brooked not long een in that dire extreme of ill ulysses was ulysses still for when oercome with

her speech half done she breaks away and sickening shuns the light of day ⁠and tears her from his gaze while he with thousand things to say ⁠still falters and delays her servants lift the sinking fair and to her marble chamber bear ⁠but good æneas though he fain would follow and console her pain with many a groan his mighty breast shaken all oer with love suppressed bows neertheless to heavens command and swiftly hies him to the strand roused by the night the trojan train haul down their navy to the main some launch the vessels some careen rough oars they bring still leafy green and timber shapeless as it grew in zeal to fly the eager crew you see them hurry to the shore and forth from all the city pour een as when ants industrious toil some mighty heap of corn to spoil and mindful of the cold to come convey their newwon booty home there moves the column long and black and threads the grass with one thin track some labouring with their shoulders strong heave huge and heavy grains along some force the stragglers into file the pathway seethes and glows the while what felt you dido in that hour ⁠what groans escaped you then beholding from your lofty tower ⁠the coast alive with men and all the port before your eyes one tumult of conflicting cries curst love what lengths of tyrant scorn wreakst not on those of woman born once more affections tear must start once more must prayers essay their art once more that high and haughty soul must suppliant stoop to loves control lest aught of aid untried remain and dido rush on death in vain ⁠see anna how their crews collect ⁠oer all the shore they crowd the sails are spread the stems are decked ⁠with festal garlands proud enough my heart foresaw this ill and sister i shall bear it still yet once but once your succour lend twas you the wretch would make his friend to you his secret thoughts confide you only know his softer side go now my sister suppliant go and thus accost our haughty foe not i with greece at aulis joined to sweep his trojans from mankind i sent no fleet to iliums coast nor vexed anchises buried ghost why should he change his ears to stone and close their portals on my moan one boon i sue for—let him bide till fair the breeze and smooth the tide not now i ask him to restore the ancient marriage he forswore resign his lovely latian town or abdicate italians crown my prayer is for a transient grace to give this madness breathingspace till fortunes discipline shall school my vanquished heart to grieve by rule vouchsafe this aid the last i crave and take requital from my grave ⁠so pleads she and her woful prayers again again her sister bears he stands immovable by tears nor tenderest words with pity hears fate bars the way a hand above his gentle ears makes deaf to love as some strong oak the mountains pride fierce alpine blasts on either side ⁠are striving to oerthrow it creaks and strains beneath the shock and from the weatherbeaten stock ⁠thick leaves the ground bestrow yet firm it stands high as its crown towers up to heaven so deep goes down ⁠its root to worlds below so in this storm of prayers the chief thrills through and through with manly grief unchanged his hearts resolves remain and falling tears are idle rain ⁠then maddened by her destiny ⁠unhappy dido prays to die tis weary to look up and see ⁠the overarching sky it chanced to fortify her heart and steel her purpose to depart before the altar as she stands she sees a blackness gather oer the chalice mantling in her hands and wine—o horror—turns to gore not een into her sisters ear she dared to breathe that tale of fear beside within her courts a fane there stood of marbles purest grain where oft she wonterrata to render vows— the chapel of her ancient spouse wreathed with white wool and sacred boughs thence when the dark was over all there came a sighing and a call ⁠as in the dead mans tone and midnights solitary bird deathboding from the roof was heard ⁠to make its long long moan and prophecies of bygone seers ring terror in her wildered ears æneas with unpitying face still hounds her in a nightly chase and still companionless she seems to tread the wilderness of dreams and vainly still her tyrians seek through desertregions ah how bleak like frantic pentheus when he sees the dragoneyed eumenides and two red suns appear to rise and thebes looks double to his eyes or as the atridan matricide ⁠runs frenzied oer the scene what time with snakes and torches plied ⁠he flees the murdered queen while at the threshold of the gate the sisterfiends expectant wait ⁠so when resolved on death she pressed that thought of frenzy to her breast the time and manner she decides then in her look the purpose hides and calling hope into her cheeks her sorrowing sister thus bespeaks my anna i have found a way ⁠rejoice oer didos love my spell upon his sense to lay ⁠or his from mine remove on oceans marge where suns descend a spot there lies the ethiops end where atlas on his shoulders rears the starry fabric of the spheres men show me there in that far place a priestess of massylian race who kept the hesperian temples pale and gave the dragon his regale guarding the trees immortal boughs with honeydew and poppy drowse her charms can cure what souls she please rob other hearts of healthful ease turn rivers backward to their source and make the stars forget their course ⁠and call up ghosts from night the ground shall bellow neath your feet the mountainash shall quit its seat ⁠and travel down the height by heaven i swear and your dear life ⁠unwillingly these arms i wield and take to meet the coming strife ⁠enchantments sword and shield you in the inner court prepare a lofty pile neath open air there duly be the armour placed left by the traitor in his haste the doffed apparel of our foe the bridal bed that wrought my woe whateer was his is doomed to fire so magic bids and i desire she paused a paleness as of death ⁠her ghastly features dyes yet anna dreams not that beneath ⁠these rites a funeral lies the frenzypitch of love and pride she knows not—dreams not worse may tide than in the hour sychæus died ⁠so on her bidding hies ⁠and now within beneath the sky the pile was rising heaped on high ⁠with oak and pinewood tree the queen enwreathes it round and weaves long chaplets of funereal leaves there lays devoted to the fire the sword forgot the doffed attire and chief the traitors effigy ⁠well knowing what should be the blazing altars stand around the priestess with her hair unbound ⁠three hundred gods proclaims grim erebus and chaos old and hecatdian power threefold ⁠three faces and three names around the lustral stream she flings drawn so she feigns from stygian springs and poisonplants by moonlight shorn ⁠she fetches not unsought and loves mysterious token torn from forehead of a foal newborn ⁠ere by the mother caught before the altars dido stands with ritual cake and stainless hands one foot unshod unchecked by bands ⁠her vestures ample flow there calls on heaven or ere she die and on the starry host on high ⁠that fates deep counsels know and makes her passionate appeal to gods if gods there be that feel ⁠for illmatched lovers woe ⁠tis night earths tired ones taste the balm ⁠the precious balm of sleep and in the forest there is calm ⁠and on the savage deep the stars are in their middle flight ⁠the fields are hushed each bird or beast that dwells beside the silver lake or haunts the tangles of the brake ⁠in placid slumber lies released from trouble by the touch of night all but the hapless queen to rest she yields not nor with eye or breast ⁠the gentle night receives her cares redouble blow on blow love storms and tossing to and fro ⁠with billowy passion heaves and thus she breathes the thoughts that roll tumultuous through her lonely soul what shall i do make proof once more of those who sought my love before in suppliance to the nomads turned whose proffered hand so oft i spurned or shall i tread the trojan deck a menial slave at each ones beck as though of gratitude they reck ⁠or think of favours done nay though i wished what haughty lord would take a humbled queen on board and know you not ah wretch forlorn the treachery of the seed forsworn ⁠of false laomedon then shall i join the shouting crew alone or with my tyrians true ⁠attach me to their train and hurry those whom scarce i tore from sidons town to tempt once more ⁠the perils of the main no die as you deserve and heal this anguish with the sharp sure steel twas you my sister first who swayed by my weak tears my peace betrayed ⁠and gave me to the foe ah had i lived estranged from love like some wild ranger of the grove ⁠nor tampered with this woe or kept at least the faith i vowed to my sychæus funeral skroud ⁠such plainings burst from that lone heart æneas ready to depart ⁠slept in his vessel laid when mercury in his dreams was seen returning with the selfsame mien ⁠and this monition made the voice the hair the blooming cheek the graceful limbs the god bespeak what with such perilous deed in hand ⁠infatuate can you sleep nor see what dangers round you stand nor hear the zephyrs from the land ⁠blow fair upon the deep she bent on death fell crime conceives and with tempestuous passion heaves and fly you not the net she weaves ⁠while yet tis time for flight with vessels all the sea will swarm and all the coast with flame be warm and fiercely glare the blazing brand if lingering on this punic land ⁠you meet the morning light away to sea a womans will is changeful and uncertain still ⁠he said and mixed with night ⁠the phantom broke æneas sleep from bed he springs with sudden leap ⁠and wakes his weary men quick rouse you gallants catch the gale sit to the oar unfurl the sail a god commissioned from on high commands us cut our cords and fly ⁠behold him yet again yes gracious power whateer thy style ⁠we gladly follow and obey o cheer us with propitious smile ⁠and send fair stars to guide our way he said his flashing sword outflew and shears the mooring ropes in two from man to man the flame flies fast they scour they scud and now the last ⁠has parted from the shore you cannot see the main for ships with emulous stroke the oarblade dips ⁠and sweeps the water oer ⁠now rising from tithonus bed the dawn on earth her freshness shed the queen from off her turret height perceives the first dim streak of light the fleet careering on its way and void and sailless shore and bay she smites her breast all snowy fair and rends her golden length of hair great jove and shall he go she cries ⁠and leave our realm a wanderers mock quick snatch your arms and chase the prize ⁠and drag the vessels from the dock fetch flames bring darts ply oars yet why what words are these or where am i why rave i thus those impious deeds— poor dido now your torn heart bleeds too late it should have bled that day when at his feet your sceptre lay lo here the chief of stainless word who takes his household gods on board whose shoulders safe from sword and fire conveyed his venerable sire o had i rent him limb from limb and cast him oer the waves to swim his friends his own ascanius killed and with the child the father filled yet danger in the strife bad been— ⁠who prates of danger here a deathdevoted desperate queen ⁠what foe had i to fear no i had sown the flame broadcast had fired the fleet from keel to mast slain son and sire stamped out the race and thrown at length with stedfast face ⁠myself upon the bier eye of the world majestic sun who seest whateer on earth is done thou juno too interpreter and witness of the hearts fond stir and hecate tremendous power in crossways howled at midnight hour avenging fiends and gods of death who breathe in dying didos breath stoop your great powers to ills that plead to heaven and my petition heed if needs must be that wretch abhorred ⁠attain the port and float to land if such the fate of heavens high lord ⁠and so the moveless pillars stand scourged by a savage enemy ⁠an exile from his sons embrace so let him sue for aid and see ⁠his people slain before his face nor when to humbling peace at length ⁠he stoops be his or life or land but let him fall in manhoods strength ⁠and welter tombless on the sand such malison to heaven i pour a last libation with my gore and tyrians you through time to come ⁠his seed with deathless hatred chase be that your

for your brow a sacrifice to stygian jove i here perform to ease my love and give to flame the fatal bed which pillowed once the trojans head thus she the aged dame gives heed and feebly hurrying

fares ⁠scales the high pile with swift ascent takes up the dardan sword and bares ⁠sad gift for different uses meant she eyed the robes with wistful look ⁠and pausing thought awhile and wept then

go exulting to the shades below let the false dardan feel the blaze that burns me pouring on his gaze and bear along to cheer his way the funeral presage of today ⁠thus as she speaks the attendant

close the deathwound gurgles deep thrice on her arm she raised her head thrice sank exhausted on the bed stared with blank gaze aloft around for light and groaned as light she found ⁠then juno pitying her long pain ⁠and all that agony of death sent iris down to part in twain ⁠the clinging limbs and struggling breath for since she perished not by fate ⁠nor fell by alien stroke deserved but rushed on death before her date ⁠by sudden spasm of frenzy nerved not yet proserpina had shred the yellow ringlet from her head nor stamped upon that pallid brow the token of the powers below so down from

from your load of clay so shears the lock the vital heats disperse and breath in air retreats meantime æneas in his bark ⁠sails on his purpose firm and fast and cuts the billows glooming dark ⁠beneath the wintry northern blast oft to the town he turns his eyes whence didos fires already rise what cause has lit so fierce a flame they know not but the pangs of shame from great love wronged and what despair can make a baffled woman dare— all this they know and knowing tread the paths of presage vague and dread ⁠the ships had passed into the main ⁠and land no longer met the eye on every side the watery plain ⁠on every side the expanse of sky when oer his head a cloud there stood ⁠with night and tempest in its womb and all the surface of the flood ⁠was ruffled by the incumbent gloom een palinure his fear confessed ⁠as from the stern he cries ah why do clouds so dark invest ⁠the compass of the skies or what has neptune sire in store this said he bids them ply the oar and brace each rope himself the sail turns edgewise to the driving gale then thus resumes my gallant lord though jove himself should pledge his word i could not look to stem the seas to italy neath skies like these the winds are changed and cross our path the west is darkening into wrath the dull air lowers in thickest mist nor can we struggle or resist come let us bow to fortunes sway and as she beckons shape our way not distant far i judge there lies ⁠your brother eryx friendly shore sicanias port if right my eyes ⁠retrace the stars they watched before æneas spoke long since tis plain the wind gives law your toil is vain ⁠let go the sheet and turn what country can i hold so sweet so welcome to my weary fleet as where acestes lives and reigns true trojan and my sires remains ⁠are resting in their urn

his comrades gathering round brave dardans born of heavenly line ⁠a year its round of months has made ⁠since in the sepulchre we laid the relics of my sire divine ⁠and mourning altars reared and now that day has come to me for ever more by heavens decree ⁠embittered and endeared that day though in gætulian wild it found me outcast and exiled though tossing oer the ægæan foam or lurking in an argive home that sacred day i still would keep and high with gifts the altars heap and now as time and place conspire een at the ashes of my sire not unconducted by the hand of favouring gods today we stand then join we gladly in the rite invoke the winds to speed our flight and pray that he we hold so dear may take our offerings year by year soon as our promised town we raise in temples sacred to his praise acestes troys descendant true bestows today on every crew ⁠two fair and stately steers invite we then the feast to grace the homegods of our own proud race ⁠and those our host reveres moreover if the dawn dispense her light to earth nine morrows hence first for the teucrians be decreed a rivalry of naval speed whose feet are swift to run the course whose arm is nerved with manly force to aim the dart and shaft aright or rawhide gauntlets wield in fight come all bold hearts and eager eyes and he that earns expect the prize now hush your tongues from idle speech and take you garlands all and each ⁠thus having said he wreathes his brow with his maternal myrtlebough so too does helymus and so acestes with his locks of snow and young ascanius and the rest obey the example and behest then to the tomb he moves along the centre of a circling throng there mindful of the rite divine two cups he pours of purest wine two of new milk and two of gore from victims on the grassy floor and scatters flowers of dazzling red and thus salutes the mighty dead hail sacred father hail again blest shade blest ashes snatched in vain ⁠from foe and fire and sea not mine with you the italian shore and latian tiber to explore ⁠whoeer that tiber be he ceased when from the tomb below ⁠a serpent clad in glittering scales ⁠seven coils seven giant volumes trails ⁠winds smoothly round the mound of green ⁠and glides the altarfires between his long back dappled with a glow half green half golden like the bow that flashes gainst the sunlit skies a thousand variegated dyes then as amazed æneas stood ⁠twixt bowl and cup the reptile wound took tithing of the sacred food ⁠and harmless vanished neath the mound with zeal renewed the duteous son applies him to the rite begun unknowing in his wondering awe how best to name the beast he saw the genius of the spot they tread or menial follower of the dead at once he slays two fatted swine two youngling sheep two sable kine pours out the sacrificial wine and on his mighty father calls the shade whom pluto disenthralls each from his store the trojans gay present their gifts their victims slay set on and heat the brimming brass then stretch them careless on the grass strow neath the spits a fiery bed and roast the flesh on embers red ⁠and now the expected day is here the ninth fair morn in lustre clear ⁠is driving oer the sky acestes name and rumour wide have summoned all the countryside they crowd the coast through breadth and length to see the feats of trojan strength ⁠and some their own to try there in the midst the gifts are seen ⁠rich tripods meet for sacrifice and garlands of luxuriant green ⁠and sprays of palm the conquerors prize with arms and purple robes of state and gold and silver talentweight and from a mound the trump proclaims the festal onset of the games ⁠first for the naval prize compete four ships the flower of all the fleet with stroke of oarsmen swift and strong brave mnestheus speeds his shark along mnestheus one day ausonias grace the founder of the memmian race chimæra moves in gyas charge huge bulk a city scarce so large with dardan rowers in triple bank the tiers ascending rank oer rank sergestus whence the sergian name commands the centaurs mighty frame while scylla is cloanthus care cluentius his italian heir far in the sea a rock there lies ⁠and fronts the spraybeat coast high oer its top the billows rise and whelm it deep what time the skies ⁠in wintry storms are lost when wind and wave are laid to sleep it stands above the moveless deep a level on whose ample breast the basking seabirds love to rest thereon an oak with leafy bole æneas plants to form a goal that helmsmans eye the spot may mark and prompt his hand to turn the bark each takes the place his lot assigns proud on the stern each captain shines ⁠with gold and purple dye the crews are wreathed with poplar green their naked shoulders oil makes sheen and now on rowingbench they sit bend to the oar their arms close knit and straining watch the sign to start while generous trembling thrills each heart ⁠and thirst for victory then at the trumpets piercing sound all from their barriers onward bound upsoars to heaven the oarsmans shout the upturned billows froth and spout in level lines they plough the deep all ocean yawns as on they sweep and threetoothed beak and plashing oar tear from its base the marble floor less swift in heady twohorse race the chariots scour the field apace ⁠when from their base they dash less eager oer the tossing manes the charioteer flings out the reins ⁠and bends him oer the lash with plaudits loud and clamorous zeal ⁠echoes the woodland round the pent shores roll the thunderpeal ⁠the stricken hills rebound mid hurry and tumultuous shout first gyas issues from the rout ⁠and holds the foremost place cloanthus next his oarsmen row more featly but his bark is slow ⁠and checks him in the race behind at equal distance strain centaur and shark the lead to gain and now the shark darts forth and now the centaur has advanced her bow and now the twain move side by side their long keels trailing through the tide ⁠at length the rock before them lay ⁠the goal was in their reach when gyas conqueror of the way his helmsman thus menœtes gray ⁠plies with upbraiding speech why to the right so blindly push ⁠here take a narrower sweep hug close the shore nor fear its crush the cliffs left hand our oars should brush ⁠let others hold the deep so gyas but menœtes fears the hidden rocks and seaward steers what swerving still he shouts once more the shore menœtes seek the shore and backward as he turns his eyes o death—cloanthus he descries close following nearer and more near and all but springing on his rear twixt gyas and the rocky shoal ⁠the rival deftly glides shoots to the forefront turns the goal ⁠and gains the safer tides grief flashed to flame in gyas soul tears from his eyes were seen to roll all reckless of his own true pride ⁠and his imperilled crew he seized the dilatory guide ⁠and from the vessel threw himself assumes the helm and cheers his merry men and shoreward steers but old menœtes when the main gave him at length to light again landward with feeble motion swims his wet clothes clinging to his limbs ascends the rock and sits on high there on the summit safe and dry to see him fall the trojans laughed ⁠they laughed to see him float and laugh as now the briny draught ⁠he sputters from his throat ⁠now mnestheus and sergestus feel a dawning hope a newborn zeal ⁠chimæra to outstrip the choice of way sergestus gets and toward the rock his helm he sets not first by all his length of bark first but by part a part the shark ⁠just covers with her tip but mnestheus pacing through and through his vessel cheers the eager crew now now my men now ply your oar who fought at hectors side of yore whom in the day of troys despair i chose my destiny to share call up the valour in your souls that made you thread gætulian shoals defy the ionian main and scape the waves that buffet maleas cape tis not the palm that mnestheus seeks no hope of victory fires his cheeks yet o that thought—but conquer they to whom great neptune wills the day not to be last—make that your aim and triumph by averting shame onward with vehement zeal they bound beneath them vanishes the ground ⁠the mailed ship labours with their blows thick pantings all their members shake and parching heats their dry lips bake ⁠while sweat in torrents flows ⁠thus as they struggle fortunes freak accords them the success they seek for while sergestus blindly rash ⁠drives to the rock his vessels head ⁠and strives the perilous pass to thread on jutting crags behold him dash loud crash the oars with shivering shock the wedged prow hangs upon the rock with shout and scream upstart the crew condemned to halt where late they flew ply steeltipped poles and pointed staves and pick the crushed oars from the waves but joyous mnestheus made more keen by vantage offering unforeseen with all his oars in rapid play and winds to waft him on his way darts forth into the shelving tides and oer the seas broad bosom glides so all at once a startled dove who builds her nest in rocky cove bursts forth and in her wild affright loud flaps her fluttering wings for flight then launched in air the smooth deep skims nor stirs a pinion as she swims so mnestheus so his vessel flees along the residue of seas the very impulse of its flight conveys it on how swift how light and first sergestus in the rear he leaves still struggling to get clear while vainly succour he implores and tries to row with shattered oars chimæra next he puts in chase her helmsman lost she yields the race cloanthus now alone remains ⁠just finishing the course whom to oertake he toils and strains ⁠with all ambitions force the cheers redouble from the shore heaven echoes with the wild uproar those blush to lose a conquering game and fain would peril life for fame these bring success their zeal to fan they can because they think they can and now perchance with vessels paired the rivals twain the prize had shared when with his palms to ocean spread cloanthus breathed a prayer and said ye gods who oer the deep have sway ⁠whose watery realm i plough before your altar in the bay a milkwhite bull i stand to slay ⁠amerced in this my vow cast forth the entrails oer the brine and pour a sacred stream of wine he said there heard him neath the sea the nereid train and panope and with his hand divinely strong portunus pushed the bark along swifter than wind or shaft it flies to land and in the haven lies ⁠æneas then assembling all proclaims aloud by heralds call cloanthus victor of the day and wreaths his conquering brows with bay three goodly bulls he bids him choose such boon is given to all the crews with wine and to his vessel bear a silver talent for its shareerrata the chiefs themselves receive beside rich gifts of more conspicuous pride a goldwrought scarf of rare device ⁠upon the conqueror he bestows around whose field meandering twice ⁠a stream of grecian purple flows inwoven there the princely boy along the wooded hills of troy is following on the flying deer with eager foot and lifted spear so keen his pants are all but heard— down swoops the thunderbearing bird and from the mountain bears away in taloned claws the beauteous prey his aged guardians raise on high their hands the fierce hounds bay the sky but he whose prowess in the race won for his bark the second place to hi m he gives a shirt of mail a threepiled work of golden scale which from demoleos breast he tore victorious once on simois shore— a garniture of glorious show nor fitted less to ward a blow beneath that burden staggering strain two stalwart squires of mnestheus train wherewith demoleos erst endued troys scattered sons on foot pursued with caldrons twain the third is graced and silverbowls with figures chased ⁠the meeds were given the rivals proud were moving stately through the crowd each glorying in his several boon and wreathed with purplebright festoon when lo unhonoured and forlorn scarce from the rock with effort torn one tier destroyed mid gibes and jeers his wavering bark sergestus steers een as a snake that on the way some wheel has mangled as it lay or passerby with stone wellaimed has left halfdying crushed and maimed in slow retreat without avail it strives its lengthening coils to trail one half erect the foe defies with hissing throat and fiery eyes one lame and wounded backward holds the surging spires and gathering folds so rows the bark on her slow way yet sets her sail and gains the bay not less her chief receives his due for ship brought back and rescued crew a cretan slave expert to spin and at her bosom children twin ⁠when ended now the naval race æneas seeks a grassy space which winding hills encompass round their shaggy tops with forests crowned there as the deepening vale descends a rustic theatre extends where ringed with thousands round he sate on highheaped throne in rural state whoeer in speed of foot would vie he here invites their chance to try and earn reward from diverse parts they come swift limbs and generous hearts trojan and sicel interspersed euryalus and nisus first that for his beauty and his youth ⁠conspicuous mid the sons of troy this for his pure affections truth ⁠concentred on the lovely boy diores next them takes his place a princely branch of priams race salius and patron too succeed the one of acarnanian breed while tegea gave the other birth and arcady his parent earth then helymus and panopes trinacrias youthful offspring these trained in the woods to chase the boar and comrades of acestes hoar with many a candidate besides whom dimeyed fame in darkness hides whom as around his seat they pressed æneas thus in brief addressed vouchsafe your audience and receive ⁠my words with glad regard none of this train the field shall leave ⁠unguerdoned by reward two polished darts of gnossian craft an axe with silverstudded haft ⁠such boon be each ones share the three who prove them first in speed shall boast a more conspicuous meed ⁠and olive chaplets wear first to the victor of the day a horse be given with trappings gay a quiver shall the second grace true amazon with shafts from thrace a belt withal of broad bright gold with jewelled clasp to clench its hold these for the second on the third this argive helmet be conferred ⁠he said at once they take their place and at the sign begin the race pour from their base like raincloud dark and strain their eyes the goal to mark first far before each flying form comes nisus rushing like the storm then nearest him where none are near young salius strains in full career then with brief interval of space euryalus the third in place then helymus behind him lo diores touching heel with toe ⁠close hangs upon his rear and had they run but few roods more had passed him shooting on before ⁠and made the vantage clear ⁠and now the race was all but oer ⁠and panting to the goal they drew when nisus trips in slippery gore chancesprinkled on the grassy floor ⁠from beasts the sacrificers slew so late the conqueror blithe and bold he fails to keep his foots sure hold and falls in prone confusion flung mid victim blood and loathly dung een then affection claims its part euryalus is in his heart uprising from the sodden clay he casts himself in salius way and salius tripped and sprawling lay euryalus like lightning flies mid plaudits and assenting cries and through his friend attains the prize next helymus and next conies in diores thus the third to win salius aloud his wrong proclaims to all who sit to view the games fills with his shouts the foremost seat claims back the prize and brands the cheat but more euryalus finds grace so well the tears beseem his face and worth appears with brighter shine when lodged within a lovely shrine diores swells the general strain ⁠just ranged within the conquering list— an empty preference all in vain ⁠should salius have the prize he missed æneas thus your rights are yours none stirs the palm my word assures let me be suffered to extend compassion to a hapless friend so speaking salius he consoled with lions hide its claws of gold outspoke bold nisus if defeat such vast requital needs must meet and falls win friends what boon of grace were large enough for nisus case whose merit made him first in place but fortune with malicious glee that baffled salius baffled me and saying thus his face he reared and showed his limbs with ordure smeared the good sire smiled and bade be brought a shield by didymaon wrought a danaan spoil which erst he tore from grecian neptunes temple door then to the gallant youth presents the guerdon and his heart contents ⁠the footrace done the meeds assigned now for the prompt collected mind ⁠stout heart and watchful eye stand forth your wrists with gauntlets bind ⁠and lift your arms on high he said and for the boxingfray ⁠two prizes he proposed a bull for him that wins the day ⁠its horns with gold enclosed a shining helmet and a glaive to reassure the beaten brave at once gigantic broad and strong amid the plaudits of the throng uprises dares who alone with paris skill dared match his own nay at the tomb where hector lies the champion butes vast of size who plumed him on an athletes breed from amycus bebrycian seed fell stricken by his conquering hand and gasped expiring on the sand such dares in the lists appears his lofty head defiant rears the compass of his shoulders shows his arms by turns before him throws and on the air expends his blows his match is sought but sought in vain not one of all that mighty train has nerve the champion to defy and round his hands the gauntlets tie so filled with overweening might and thinking all declined the fight before the chief he takes his stand lays on the bullocks horn his hand ⁠and thus in triumph cries why goddessborn this vain delay if none dare venture on the fray how long shall justice be deferred t were decent now to give the word ⁠and bid me take the prize with shouts the trojan host agreed and claimed their champions promised meed ⁠now with rebuke acestes plies entellus who beside him lies ⁠upon the grassy sward entellus whom erewhile we thought our bravest hero all for nought and will you then the strife forego and see borne off without a blow ⁠the champions proud reward where now the pupils loyal pride in mighty eryx deified the fame that spread trinacria oer the trophies hanging from your door nay cries the chief no coward dread has made ambition hide her head but strength is slack in limbs grown old and aged blood runs dull and cold had i the thing i once possessed which makes yon braggart rear his crest had i but youth no need had been of gifts to lure me to the green no though the bull were twice as fair tis not the prize should make me dare then on the ground in open view two gloves of giant weight he threw which eryx once in combat plied and braced him with the tough bullhide in speechless wonder all behold seven mighty hides with fold on fold enwrap the fist and iron sewed and knobs of lead augment the load een dares starts in sheer dismay and shuns the desperate essay the gauntlets weight æneas tries and handles their enormous size then fetching speech from out his breast the veteran thus the train addressed what if the gauntlets you had seen ⁠alcides wore that day had stood on this ensanguined green ⁠and watched the fatal fray these gloves your brother eryx wore still stained you see with brains and gore with those gainst hercules he stood with these i fought while youthful blood supplied me strength nor age had shed its envious winter on my head but if the arms sicilians wield deter the trojan from the field if so æneas thoughts incline ⁠and so my chief approves let both be equal side and side i spare you eryx grim bullhide dismiss that terror and resign ⁠in turn your trojan gloves he said and from his shoulders throws ⁠the robe he wont to use his mighty frames contexture shows ⁠his mighty arms and thews and in the middle of the sand in giant greatness takes his stand ⁠then good anchises son supplies two pairs of gauntlets matched in size equips the combatants alike and sets them front to front to strike raised on his toes each champion stands and fearless lifts in air his hands their heads thrown back avoid the stroke their mighty arms the fight provoke that on elastic youth relies this on vast limbs and giant size but the huge knees with age are slack and fitful gasps the deep chest rack full many a wound the heroes rain each on the other still in vain their hollow sides return the sound their battered chests the shock rebound mid ears and temples come and go the wandering gauntlets to and fro the jarred teeth chatter neath the blow firm stands entellus in his place a column rooted on its base his watchful eye and shrinking frame alone avoid the gauntlets aim like leaguer who invests a town or sits before a hillfort down the younger champion tasks his art to find the bulwarks weakest part this way and that unwearied scans and vainly tries a thousand plans entellus rising to the blow puts forth his hand the wary foe midway in air the mischief spied and deftly shifting slipped aside entellus force on air is spent heavily down with prone descent he falls as from its roots uprent a pine falls hollow on the side of erymanth or lofty ide loud clamouring from their seats arise ⁠troys and trinacrias sons the shouts mount upward to the skies ⁠and first acestes runs and tenderly from eartherrata uprears his ancient friend of equal years but not disheartened by his foil the champion rises from the soil with wrath he goads his sluggard might and turns him fiercer to the fight the smouldering mass is stirred to flame by conscious worth and glowing shame ablaze with fury he pursues ⁠the trojan oer the green and now his right hand deals the bruise ⁠and now his left as keen no pause no respite fierce and fast as hailstones rattle down the blast on sloping roofs with blow on blow he buffets dares to and fro but good æneas suffered not ⁠the strife to rage too far or ere entellus waxed more hot ⁠he bade him cease the war delivered dares sore distressed and thus with soothing words addressed alas what frenzy of the mind has made you hapless friend so blind perceive you not the powers have changed and left the side where once they ranged give way to heaven such speech he made and as he spoke the combat stayed but dares by a friendly throng all helplessly is dragged along trailing his knees his weight beneath ⁠swaying his head from side to side while clotted gore and loosened teeth ⁠pour from his mouth in mingled tide they bear him to the ships away ⁠then at a call receive the helm and sword the bull and bay ⁠they with entellus leave with triumph kindling in his eyes and glorying in the bull his prize the victor to the concourse cries learn goddessborn and iliums host what strength my youthful arm could boast and what the death from whose dark door your rescued dares you restore he spoke and stood before the bull swung back his arm and planted full ⁠between its horns the gauntlets blow the brain came through the shattered skull ⁠prone quivering dead the beast lies low while words like these the veteran said in consecration of the dead this better substitute i pay ⁠eryx to thee for dares life and here renounce as conqueror may ⁠the gauntlets and the strife ⁠the champions next who would compete in archer skill with arrow fleet æneas summons and ordains the gifts that shall reward their pains his mighty hand erects a mast ⁠plucked from serestus bark and to its top a dove makes fast ⁠to be the bowmans mark the rivals gather to the spot a brazen helm receives each lot and first amid applauding cries hippocoons name to daylight flies next mnestheus wreathed with olive crown mnestheus whose vessel earned renown third in the list eurytion came thy brother pandarus mighty name whose arrow charged to break the peace first fluttered through the ranks of greece last at the bottom of the casque ⁠acestes lot appears he too adventuring to the task ⁠that matches younger years ⁠they bend their bows like men of worth and from the case their shafts draw forth and first from off the twanging string hippocoons feathered dart takes wing achieves the passage and sticks fast full in the centre of the mast the stout tree quivers the scared bird flaps and applauding peals are heard then mnestheus raises toward the sky his bow and levels shaft and eye— but ah the dove he might not wound ⁠his arrow cuts the flaxen ties which to the mast had held her bound ⁠and forth into the clouds she flies with shaft already aimed for flight ⁠eurytion to his brother vowed triumphant as she wings the height ⁠he strikes the dove beneath a cloud pierced to the heart she leaves behind her life to mingle with the wind and as she tumbles to the ground the weapon in her side is found ⁠and now of victory bereft acestes at the end is left yet still he shoots in air to show his veteran skill and sounding bow when sudden lo the gazers see a sign of mightiest augury the dire event the truth revealed and seers too late their warnings pealed een in the mid expanse of skies the arrow kindles as it flies behind it draws a fiery glare then wasting vanishes in air so stars dislodged athwart the night career and trail a length of light in wonder either nation gazed their souls to heaven in prayer upraised nor great æneas dared disown the omen by the gods foreshown acestes to his heart he pressed with presents heaped and thus addressed take this my father tis decreed

twixt the soaked timbers oozes slow thick vapour from the smouldering tow the threads of pestilential flame steal downward through each vessels frame nor all the efforts of the brave nor streaming

to mortals in distress o let the fleet escape the flame o save from death troys dying name or if my deeds the stroke demand then father bare thy red right hand send forth thy lightning and oerwhelm the poor remainder of our realm scarce had he ended when from high ⁠pours down a burst of rain and thunder rolling round the sky ⁠shakes rising ground and plain all heaven lets loose its watery store the clouds are massed the south winds roar with sluicing rain the ships are drenched till every spark at last is quenched and all the barks save only four escape the fiery conqueror ⁠but good æneas all distraught ⁠by that too cruel blow in dire perplexity of thought ⁠alternates to and fro still doubting should he take his rest unmindful of the fates behest in sicily or make once more an effort for the italian shore then nautes whose experienced mind pallas made sage beyond his kind interpreting what heavens dread ire might threaten or the fates require breathes counsel in æneas ear and strives his anxious soul to cheer my chief let fate cry on or back tis ours to follow nothing slack whateer betide he only cures the stroke of fortune who endures lo here acestes the divine himself a

righteous souls mid happy glades the virgin sibyl with the gore of sable sheep shall ope the door then shall you learn your future line and what the walls the fates assign and now farewell dewsprinkled night has scaled olympus topmost height i catch their panting breath from far the steeds of mornings cruel star he said and vanished out of sight like thinnest smoke and mixed with night while whither now æneas cries ⁠what makes thee hurry thus apace whom fliest thou what constraint denies ⁠a father to his sons embrace with that he wakes the slumbering fire adores the homegod of his

subjects and his friends three calves to eryx next he kills a lambkins blood to tempest spills ⁠and bids them loose from land with oliveleaves he binds his brow then takes his station on the prow ⁠a charger in his hand flings out the entrails on the brine and pours a sacred stream of wine fair winds escort them oer the deep with emulous stroke the waves they sweep ⁠but venus torn by many a fear thus breathes her plaint in neptunes ear fell junos persecuting ire still raging with unsated fire compels me neptune to abase my pride and humbly sue for grace no lapse of time how long soeer nor all the force of duteous prayer nor hest of jove nor will of fate that changeless rancour can abate tis not enough to have devoured a queenly city walled and towered and made the wretched captives drain een to its dregs the cup of pain she still pursues the flying rout and strives to stamp the last spark out— strange mystery of hatred known to none but to herself alone thyself wast there when lately she raised tumult in the libyan sea thou sawst in what confusion blent she mingled main and firmament armed with æolian storms in vain in bold defiance of thy reign now working on the trojan dames she foully wraps our fleet in flames and drives the crews their vessels lost to settle on an unknown coast thus then for what remains i crave thine own safe conduct oer the wave that so emerging from the main laurentian tiber they may gain if what i ask is ruled in heaven if there the city fate has given great oceans lord replied tis just cytheras queen my realm should trust ⁠which erst her being gave and ofttimes too has neptune won her confidence by service done ⁠in calming wind and wave nor een on earth let xanthus speak and simois has my arm been weak ⁠thy gallant son to save when fierce achilles from the coast drove to their walls troys panting host while the choked rivers gasped for breath and gave whole multitudes to death and labouring xanthus strove in vain to roll his waters to the main then as æneas undismayed with weaker strength and feebler aid pelides met i barred the fray and bore him in a cloud away though all my will was to destroy my own creation perjured troy and now as then my heart is set to work him good thy fears forget avernus haven he shall see in safety where he fain would be one life alone shall glut the wave one head shall fall the rest to save ⁠thus having soothed the goddess cares his fiery steeds the father pairs with foamy bit each fierce mouth checks then flings the reins upon their necks along the surface of the tides his seagreen chariot smoothly glides hushed by his wheels the billows lie the stormclouds vanish from the sky his vassals follow in his wake seamonsters of enormous make palæmon child of inos strain with glaucus venerable

fly swift first palinurus leads the way the rest observe him and obey now nights fleet coursers almost reach ⁠the summit of the sky the weary oarsmen all and each ⁠along the benches lie when lo false sleep on pinions light drops down from heaven and cleaves the night sad dreams to thee beneath his wings unhappy palinure he brings lights on the stern in phorbas guise and thus with soft enticement

beguile myself will take for that short space the rudder and supply your place scarce lifting from the heaven his eyes the wary palinure replies what i the dupe of oceans wiles i trust this fiend that fawns and smiles commit æneas to the gale who oft have proved how false its tale thus as he speaks his hand and eye cleave to the rudder and the sky when lo the god a slumberous bough ⁠with dews of styx and lethe wet shakes gently oer the watchers brow ⁠and seals those eyes so firmly set scarce had the loosening limbs given way the demon falls upon his prey and hurls him dragging woodwork rent and rudder in his prone descent with headlong ruin to the main invoking friendly aid in vain himself resumes his wings and flies aloft into the buoyant skies yet still the fleet by neptunes aid floats onward safe and undismayed till as they near the sirens shore a perilous neighbourhood of yore ⁠and white with mounded bones where the hoarse sea with farheard roar ⁠keeps washing on the stones the good chief feels the vessel sway no steersman to direct its way and takes himself the helm and guides their progress through the darkling tides full many a heartfetched groan he heaved thus of his

still by his side achates moves companion to the chief he loves ⁠as thoughtful and as slow much talked they on their onward way debating whose the senseless clay ⁠that claims a comrades tomb when on the naked shore behold they see misenus dead and cold ⁠destroyed by ruthless doom the son of æolus than who none ere more skilled the trumpet blew to animate the warrior crew ⁠and martial fire relume

prowlers leafy lair the pitchtree falls beneath the stroke the sharp axe rings upon the oak through beechen core the wedge goes deep the ash comes rolling down the steep æneas stirs his comrades zeal and foremost wields the workman steel in moody silence he surveys the boundless grove at last he prays ah would some god but show me now in all that wood the golden bough my poor poor friend in thee alas the sibyls words have come to pass scarce had he said when lo there flew two snowwhite doves before his view ⁠and on the sward took rest his mothers birds the hero knew ⁠and joyful prayer addrest hail gentle guides before me fly and mark my pathway on the sky so lead me where the bough of gold glooms rich above its parent mould and thou my mother aid my quest nor leave me doubtful and distrest he stayed his steps intent to know what signs they give which way they go by turns they feed by turns they fly just in the range of human eye till when they scent the noisome gale which dark avernus jaws exhale aloft they rise in rapid flight then on the tree at once alight where flashing through the leaves is seen the golden boughs contrasted sheen as in the depth of winters snow the parasitic mistletoe bursts with fresh bloom and clothes anew the smooth bare stems with saffron hue so mid the oaks umbrageous green the gleam of leafy gold was seen so mid the sounds of whispering trees the thin foil tinkled in the breeze at once æneas grasps the spray his haste oercomes its coy delay and laden with the newwon prize beneath the sibyls roof he hies ⁠nor less meanwhile the trojans pay to dead misenus thankless clay ⁠the last memorial rite and first a giant pile they raise with oak and fir to feed the blaze with darkleaved boughs its sides enlace sad cypresses before it place ⁠and deck with armour bright some fix the caldron heat the wave and oil the corpse which first they lave loud wails are heard then on his bed the weeping done they stretch the dead and heap above the cold limbs oer the purple robes the living wore some lend their shoulders to the bier a ministration sad and drear and as their fathers wont apply the firebrands with averted eye while streaming oil and offered spice blaze up with flesh of sacrifice and now when sank the embers down ⁠and ceased the flame to burn the smouldering heap with wine they drown and corynæus from the pyre collects the bones charred white by fire ⁠and stores in brazen urn then to his comrades thrice he gave lustration from the flowing wave with showery dew and olive bough besprinkling each polluted brow ⁠and spoke the last acclaim but good æneas bids arise a funeral mound of mighty size there plants the arms the warrior bore the trumpet and the shapely oar beneath a mountain high in air which bears and evermore shall bear ⁠from him misenus name ⁠this done he hastens to fulfil the dictates of the sibyls will before his eyes a monstrous cave ⁠expands its yawning womb protected by the lakes dark wave ⁠and forests leafy gloom oer that dread space no flying thing unjeopardied could ply its wing such noisome exhalations rise from out its darkness to the skies here first the priestess sets in view four goodly bulls of sable hue ⁠and twixt their horns pours forth the wine the topmost hairs she next plucks out that bristling on the forehead sprout ⁠an offering to the flame divine on hecate the while she cries the mighty one of shades and skies some neath the throat thrust in the knife and catch in cups the stream of life to earth and night the furies dam æneas slays a black ewelamb and bids a barren heifer bleed for thee dread proserpine decreed to pluto then he sets alight high altars flaming through the night ⁠and on the embers lays whole bulls denuded of their hide still pouring oil in copious tide ⁠to feed the surging blaze when lo as mornings orient red ⁠just brightens oer the sky the firm ground bellows neath their tread the wooded summits rock and sway and through the shade the hellhounds bay ⁠proclaims the goddess nigh back ye unhallowed shrieks the seer and leave the whole wide forest clear come great æneas tread the way ⁠and keep your falchion bared now for a heart that scorns dismay ⁠now for a soul prepared this said with madness in her face ⁠she plunged into the cave he with her lengthening stride keeps pace ⁠as fearless and as brave ⁠eternal powers whose sway controls the empire of departed souls ye too throughout whose wide domain blank night and grisly silence reign hoar chaos awful phlegethon what ear has heard let tongue make known vouchsafe your

rushing on the foe and cleaving with an idle blow ⁠the unsubstantial air ⁠the threshold passed the road leads on to tartarus and to acheron at distance rolls the infernal flood seething and swollen with turbid mud and into dark cocytus pours the burden of its oozy stores grim squalid foul with aspect dire his eyeballs each a globe of fire the watery passage charon keeps sole warden of those murky deeps a sordid mantle round him thrown girds breast and shoulder like a zone he plies the pole with dexterous ease or sets the sail to catch the breeze ferrying the legions of the dead in bark

drowsy night no airy current half so light ⁠meantime æneas in the vale ⁠a sheltered forest sees deep woodlands where the evening gale ⁠goes whispering through the trees and lethe river which flows by those dwellings of tranquillity nations and tribes in countless ranks were crowding to its verdant banks as bees afield in summer clear beset the flowerets far and near and round the fair white lilies pour the deep hum sounds the champaign oer æneas startled at the scene asks wondering what the noise may mean what river this or what the throng that crowds so thick its banks along his sire replies the souls are they whom fate will reunite to clay there stooping down on lethes brink a deep oblivious draught they drink fain would i muster in review before your eyes that shadowy crew that you their sire may joy with me to think of newfound italy o father and can thought conceive that happy souls this realm would leave ⁠and seek the upper sky with sluggish clay to reunite this direful

though clogged in part by limbs of clay and the dull vesture of decay hence wild desires and grovelling fears and human laughter human tears immured in dungeonseeming night they look abroad yet see no light nay when at last the life has fled and left the body cold and dead een then there passes not away the painful heritage of clay full many a long contracted stain perforce must linger deep in grain so penal sufferings they endure for ancient crime to make them pure some hang aloft in open view for winds to pierce them through and through while others purge their guilt deepdyed in burning fire or whelming tide each for himself we all sustain the durance of our ghostly pain then to elysium we repair the few and breathe this blissful air till many a length of ages past the inherent taint is cleansed at last and nought remains but ether bright the quintessence of heavenly light all these when centuries ten times told the wheel of destiny have rolled the voice divine from far and wide

he took and pressed the hand of his illustrious guest advancing through the grove they wind and leave the rivers bank behind ⁠and now with many a courteous word the prince of troy his suit preferred worthiest and best of danaan race whom fortune bids me sue for grace ⁠with signs of suppliant need i feared not to approach you i though sprung from grecian arcady ⁠allied to atreus seed heavens

youths first blossom clad i gazed at priam and his train of trojan lords and gazed again but great anchises princely tall was more than priam more than all with boyish zeal i schemed and planned to greet the chief and grasp his hand i ventured and with eager zest to pheneus brought my honoured guest a lycian quiver he bestowed at parting with its arrowy load a goldwrought scarf and bridle reins of gold which pallas still retains so now the troth you ask i plight and soon as morning lends her light a troop shall lead you on your way and ample stores your need purvey meanwhile since happy chance invites your presence share these annual rites which heaven forbids us to postpone and make our friendly boards your own once more he calls for wine and meats and sets the chiefs on grassy seats æneas first on maple throne with lions shaggy hide bestrown while youths attendant on the priest bring roasted flesh of victim beast wrought ceres gifts in baskets pile and make the cups with bacchus smile so plied with food the strangers dine on entrails and on bullocks chine ⁠when hungers rage at length was stayed and craving appetite allayed evander speaks this solemn day the feast we serve the rites we pay not these the freaks of fancy strange blind to the past and bent on change no trojan guest deliverance wrought from direful ill the lesson taught the yearly honours we renew but render thanks where thanks are due behold yon beetling cliff oerhung those crags in wild confusion flung that mountaindwelling all forlorn and rocks from their foundations torn beneath the hill a cavern ran where cacus lived half beast half man ⁠no sunbeam eer came in the wet ground reeked with freshspilt gore and human heads adorned the door ⁠with foul and ghastly grin dark vulcan was the monsters sire he vomited vulcanian fire and glorying in so proud a birth shook with his bulk the solid earth we too when yearning to be freed found heavenly succour in our need at length a strong avenger came alcides in the glow of fame ⁠from geryon spoiled and killed his captured bulls he led this way victorious and the stately prey ⁠bankside and valley filled but cacus spurred by furies on to leave no wickedness undone four bulls four heifers beauteous all bears off in plunder from the stall and these to hide their track he trails back through the valley by their tails and thus the footprints all reversed conceals them in his lair accursed no sign no mark the foray gave to lead the seeker to the cave till when at last amphitryons son removed his herd their pasture done ⁠and stood prepared to go the oxen at departing fill with noisy utterance grove and hill ⁠and breathe a farewell low when hark a heifer from the den makes answer to the sound again ⁠and mocks her wily foe black choler filled alcides heart he snatches club and bow and dart ⁠and scales the mountains height then nor till then was cacus seen with quailing eye and troubled mien swifter than swiftest wind he flies at once and to the cavern hies ⁠while terror wings his flight scarce had he gained the cavern door and lowered the rock that hung before fixed by his fathers art the strain makes the stout doorposts start again when lo the fierce tirynthian came his vengeful spirit all on flame darts here and there his blazing eye if haply entrance he may spy ⁠and grinds for rage his teeth and thrice the mountain he surveyed ⁠thrice the blocked gate in vain essayed thrice rested and took breath a pointed rock on all sides steep rose high above that dungeonkeep abrupt and craggy fitted best for noisome birds to build their nest this as it frowned above the tide he pushed from the remoter side ⁠and from its socket tore then hurled it down the high heavens crack the river to its source runs back ⁠and shore recoils from shore then cacus mansion stood displayed the cave revealed its depth of shade ⁠as though by some strange might earth parting to her inmost core should show the realms that gods abhor the vast abyss lie bare to day and spectres huddle in dismay ⁠at influx of the light there as surprised with sudden glare the monster pent within his lair ⁠in hideous fashion roars alcides plies him from on high with all his dread artillery ⁠and trunk and millstone pours he powerless to elude or flee black smoke disgorges dire to see ⁠with darkness floods the room blots out all prospect from the sight and makes another deeper night ⁠half lightning and half gloom alcides chafing as for shame dashed onward headlong through the flame where thickest spout the jets of smoke and blackest clouds the cavern choke there as in vain he fumed and hissed he locked him in a deadly twist and cleaving clinging throttling strained his starting eyes his throat blooddrained the victor now the doors downtorn ⁠the loathsome den reveals displays the oxen late forsworn and the foul carcase drags in scorn ⁠to daylight by the heels the rustics view with wild surprise ⁠the body oer and oer that shaggy breast those dreadful eyes ⁠those jaws that flame no more henceforth our tribes observance pay and keep with joy this solemn day potitius foremost and the line pinarian warders of the shrine

⁠meantime the sun has stooped from high and nears the downfall of the sky potitius and the priestly band come clad in skins with torch in hand once more the banquet is restored rich dainties grace the second board the victims choicest parts bestowed on bending plates the altars load the salian minstrels come their brows engarlanded with poplar boughs ⁠two bands one old one young the deeds of

fulfilled when haughty juno ironwilled ⁠with destiny combined thy conquering arm the cloudborn twain hylæus pholus both has slain thou layst the cretan monster low and that fell beast that met his foe

canst lend a grace vouchsafe thy presence here today to us and to the rites we pay so mingle they their praise and prayer ⁠and add to crown his fame grim cacus in his robberlair ⁠outbreathing smoke and flame the sacred forest thrilled with sound reechoes and the hills rebound ⁠and now the train their worship oer back to the city wend once more heavy with age the king moves on and keeps æneas and his son close at his side while various talk makes light the burden of the walk admiringly the trojan plies from side to side his glancing eyes feels every charm and asks and hears each record of departed years then spoke the venerable king from whom o rome thy glories spring this forest ground from times first dawn was held by natives nymph and faun men who from stocks their birth had drawn ⁠and oaks of hardest grain no arts were theirs they knew not how to couple oxen to the plough to store their treasured goods or spare the teeming boughs supplied their fare ⁠and beasts in hunting slain then from olympus height came down good saturn exiled from his crown ⁠by jove his mightier heir he brought the race to union first erewhile on mountaintops dispersed and gave them statutes to obey and willed the land wherein he lay ⁠should latiums title bear that was the storied age of gold so peacefully serenely rolled ⁠the years beneath his reign at length stole on a baser age and wars indomitable rage ⁠and greedy lust of gain ausonians and sicanians came and saturns land oft changed her name came too the monarchs tibris grim the royal giant large of limb whose name thenceforth the river bore and albula was known no more myself an exile from my home went wandering far along the foam till mighty chance and destined doom ⁠constrained my errant choice so came i to these regions driven by warning from my mother given ⁠and phœbus awful voice then as they take their onward ways a gate and altar he displays ⁠romes own carmental gate in after years such honour found evanders mother nymph renowned carmentis first of seers who sung the heroes from æneas sprung ⁠and pallanteums fate next at the grove their feet are stayed which romulus the asylum made lupercals gelid cave they see named from the god of arcady then shows he argiletums wood appealing to the scene of blood and tells the tale of argus end perfidious argus once his friend then to tarpeias dread abode and capitol he points the road now all is golden then twas all oergrown with trees and brushwood tall een then rude hinds the spot revered een then the wood the rock they feared here in this grove these wooded steeps some god unknown his mansion keeps ⁠arcadias children deem their eyes have looked on joves own form when oft he summons cloud and storm ⁠and seen his ægis gleam see you yon towers in hoar decay the relics and memorials grey ⁠of old ancestral fame this janus that king saturn walled and this janiculum was called ⁠that bore saturnias name so talking on at length they come to poor evanders lowly home there where carinæs mansions shine where spreads the forum lowed the kine the palace reached these gates he cried alcides entered in his pride ⁠this house the god contained thou too take courage wealth despise and fit thee to ascend the skies nor be a poor mans courtesies ⁠rejected or disdained he spoke and through the narrow door ⁠the great æneas led and heaped a couch upon the floor ⁠with leaves and bearskin spread ⁠night falls and earth and living things are folded in her sable wings but venus with a mothers dread ⁠at latiums wild alarm to vulcan on the golden bed spoke breathing on each word she said ⁠sweet loves enticing charm when greece was labouring to destroy the fated battlements of troy no aid from thee i cared to ask ⁠for troys unhappy race nor chose in vain for arms to task ⁠thy labour or thy grace though much to priams sons i owed and oft my tears of pity flowed ⁠for my æneas case and now his foot by joves command is planted on rutulian land thus then behold me suppliant here low at those knees i most revere behold a tender mother plead arms are the boon her sons the need not vainly nereus daughter pled not vain the tears aurora shed what nations see what towns combine to draw the sword gainst me and mine she ceased her snowy arms enwound her faltering husband round and round the wonted fire at once he feels through all his veins the passion steals swift as the lightnings fiery glare runs glimmering through the thunderous air his spouse in conscious beauty smiled to see his heart by love beguiled smit to the core with heavenly fire in fondling tone returns the sire why stray so far thy pleas to seek has trust in vulcan grown so weak had such my queen been then thy bent een then to troy had arms been lent nor jove nor fate refused to give to priam ten more years to live and now if war be in the air and battles need thy present care what molten gold or iron can with fire to fuse and winds to fan all shall be thine thy power confess nor seek by prayers to feign it less he said and to his bosom pressed his beauteous queen and sank to rest ⁠the night had crowned the cope of heaven and sleeps first fading bloom had driven ⁠the slumber from mens eyes een at the hour when prudent wife who day by day to eke out life ⁠minervas distaff plies relumes her fire oerreaching night and tasks her maidens by its light to keep her husbands bed from stain and for their babes a pittance gain so nor less swift at labours claim springs from his couch the lord of flame fast by æolian lipare ⁠and fair sicanias coast an island rises from the sea ⁠with smoking rocks embossed beneath a cavern drear and vast hollowed by cyclopean blast ⁠rings with unearthly sound bruised anvils clang their thunderpeal hot hissing glows the chalyb steel and fiery vapour fierce and fast ⁠pants up from underground the centre this of vulcans toil and vulcans name adorns the soil here finds he as he makes descent the cyclops oer their labour bent brontes and steropes are there and gaunt pyracmon stripped and bare the thunderbolt was in their hand which jove sends down to scourge the land a part was barbed and formed to kill a part remained imperfect still three rays they took of forky hail ⁠of watery cloud three rays three of the winged southern gale ⁠three of the ruddy blaze now wrath they mingle swift to harm and glare and noise and loud alarm elsewhere for mars they plan the car wherewith he maddens into war ⁠strong towns and spearmen bold and burnish pallas shirt of mail the ægis bright with dragons scale ⁠and netted rings of gold the twisted serpentlocks they shape and gorgons head lopped at the nape ⁠her dying eyes yet rolled away with these he cried away my sons and list what now i say a mighty chief of arms has need now prove your skill your strength your speed begone delay no further speech each takes the part assigned to each ⁠and plies the work with zeal in streams the gold the copper flows and in the mighty furnace glows ⁠the deathinflicting steel a shield they plan whose single guard may all the blows of latium ward and fold on fold together bind seven circles round one centre twined some make the windy billows heave now give forth air and now receive the copper hisses in the wave the anvils press the groaning cave with measured cadence each and all the giant hammers rise and fall the griping pincers deftly plied turn the rough ore from side to side ⁠while thus in distant caves the sire bestirs the brethren of the fire the gracious dawn the vocal bird beneath his eaves at daybreak heard ⁠bid old evander rise a linen tunic he indues and round his feet tyrrhenian shoes ⁠in rustic fashion ties a sword he fastens to his side and wears for scarf a panthers hide two watchdogs from the palace gate come forth and on their master wait so mindful of his plighted word he seeks his guest the trojan lord æneas too with willing feet as early moves his host to meet achates on his chief attends ⁠beside evander walks his son each guest and host his hand extends they sit them down and talk as friends ⁠when thus the king begun great chief of troy whose safety shows that ilium still survives her foes albeit a mighty name be ours yet scanty are our martial powers here tiber bounds us there the din of rutule warfare hems us in strong succour neertheless i bring great nations rich with many a king by chance they stand before our gate you join us at the call of fate far hence agyllas city stands built like our own by alien hands there warlike lydias ancient stock is planted on the etruscan rock long years of prosperous empire past mezentius took the throne at last by arms compelled them to obey and governed with a tyrants sway why tell the blood the monster spilt each freak of madness or of guilt nay—heaven return it on his head— he chained the living to the dead hand joined to hand and face to face in noisome pestilent embrace so trickling down with foul decay they wore their lingering lives away but wearied out with tyrannies in arms at length his people rise besiege his gates his guards lay low and firebrands to his rooftree throw he mid the tumult of the strife so fortune willed escapes with life to haughty turnus kingdom flies and hides him with his old allies etruria glows with righteous ire all sheathed in arms his head require now gallant guest this numerous band i offer to your sole command around the shore their vessels crowd and call for action fierce and loud an aged seer their speed restrains rehearsing things which heaven ordains brave sons of brave mæonian sires whom dark mezentius rule inspires ⁠with wrath and righteous grief no leader of italian blood may head so vast a multitude ⁠choose ye a foreign chief scared by heavens voice the etruscan train sits down in arms in yonder plain an envoy sent from tarchon brings the sceptre of etrurias kings and bids me join the camp and wear the crown and be the kingdoms heir but envious age for war too late forbids evander to be great my son perchance the host might lead but born of sabine mothers seed ⁠a half italian he you blest alike in age and race assume brave prince the chieftains place ⁠oer troy and italy nay more my hope my only joy i give you too my noble boy the martial lore of service stern beneath your conduct he shall learn with reverence on your actions gaze and tread your steps from earliest days two hundred men with each his steed i send with him arcadias breed and pallas from his own good store shall furnish forth two hundred more ⁠he ended and in musing mood æneas and achates stood dark thoughts came thick when lo from heaven a sudden sign by venus given swift runs athwart the skys clear field ⁠a thunder and a glare all nature to her centre reeled and east and west through ether pealed ⁠the tyrrhene trumpets blare they look yet once and once again deep growls the thunder in his den and armour veiled in cloud is seen high in the azure space serene to glimmer with a ruddy sheen ⁠and hurtle in the air the rest are fixed in awe profound æneas hails the expected sound ⁠and owns his mothers hand ask not he cries much honoured friend what chance these prodigies portend ⁠tis i the skies demand this sign to send my mother vowed ⁠if war was on the wing herself to aid me through the cloud ⁠vulcanian arms would bring alas what havoc soon shall seize laurentums wretched families what reckoning turnus yours to pay ⁠what burdens shalt thou roll helmets and shields and mangled clay ⁠where dwelt a warriors soul hoar tiber call to arms and break with treacherous ease the leagues ye make ⁠he said and from his throne upleapt awakes the altarfires that slept and pays the rites of morning hours to hercules and homegod powers the trojans and arcadias king alike their chosen victims bring then turning shoreward he reviews his vessels and arrays the crews of these the first in martial might he takes to follow him in fight the rest drop down the stream to bear iulus tidings how they fare ⁠his father and the cause each has his steed of all the train that marches to the tuscan plain a charger for the chief is led with tawny lions hide bespread ⁠that shines with gilded claws fame to the little town relates the horse are marching to the gates the matrons with redoubled zeal make vows to heaven in wild appeal fear closer treads on dangers heel ⁠and larger looms the fray the tears roll down evanders face he holds his child in strict embrace ⁠and thus begins to say ah would but jupiter restore the strength i had in days of yore when conqueror in prænestes fields i fired a pile of foemens shields and hurried with my own right hand king erulus to the darksome land three lives inspired that monstrous frame when from feronias womb he came three swords he wielded gainst the foe three deaths it cost to lay him low yet thrice this hand shed out his gore and thrice stripped off the arms he wore ah never then should wars alarms dispart me from my darlings arms nor had mezentius done despite so foully to a neighbours right or made my widowed city feel the havoc of his ruthless steel yet o ye gods and o great jove have pity on a fathers love ⁠and hear evanders prayer if tis your purpose to restore my pallas to my arms once more if living is to see his face then grant me life of your dear grace ⁠no toil too hard to bear but ah if fortune be my foe and meditate some crushing blow now now the thread in mercy break while hope sees dim and cares mistake while still i clasp thee darling boy my latest and my only joy nor let assurance worse than fear with cruel tidings wound my ear his speech grows faint his limbs give way his slaves their master home convey ⁠now through the open gates at last the mounted company had passed æneas and achates lead the other lords of troy succeed young pallas in the midst is seen with broidered scarf and armour sheen like lucifer the daysprings star to radiant venus dearest far ⁠of all the sons of light when bathed in oceans wave he rears his sacred presence mid the spheres ⁠and dissipates the night the matrons on the rampart stand ⁠their straining eyes pursue the dusty cloud the mailclad band ⁠far flashing on the view through thicket and entangled brake the nearest road the warriors take ⁠and hark the warcrys sound the line is formed and horny feet recurrently the champaign beat ⁠and shake the crumbling ground a grove by cæres river grows ancestral reverence round it throws ⁠a terror far and wide the shelving hills around have made a girdle for the pinewood shade ⁠set close on every side twas there pelasgian tribes men say ⁠who dwelt in latiums clime of old kept good silvanus holiday ⁠the guardian god of field and fold hard by encamped there held their post brave tarchon and his tyrrhene host and from the hilltop might be seen their legions stretching oer the green the trojans join them on the mead and seek refreshment man and steed ⁠but careful venus heavenly fair had journeyed through the clouds of air ⁠her present in her hands deep in the vale her son she spied reposing by the riverside ⁠and thus before him stands lo thus the gods their word fulfil behold the arms my husbands skill ⁠has fashioned in a day fear not conclusions soon to try with latiums braggarts but defy ⁠een turnus to the fray then to her sons embrace she flew the armour neath an oak in view ⁠she placed all dazzling bright he glorying in the beauteous prize from point to point quick darts his eyes ⁠with evernew delight now wondering twixt his hands he turns the helm that like a meteor burns ⁠the sword that rules the war the breastplate shooting bloody rays as dusky clouds in sunlight blaze ⁠refulgent from afar the polished greaves of molten gold the spear

while others slept golden their hair on head and chin gold collars deck their milkwhite skin ⁠short cloaks with colours checked shine on their backs two spears each wields of alpine make and oblong shields ⁠their brawny limbs protect luperci here of raiment stripped ⁠and dancing salii move and flamens with their caps wooltipped ⁠and shields that fell from jove and highborn dames parade the streets in pensile cars with cushioned seats far off he sets the gates of dis and tartarus terrible abyss ⁠and dooms to guilt assigned there catiline on frowning steep hangs poised above the infernal deep ⁠with furyforms behind and righteous souls apart he draws with cato there to give them laws twixt these in wavy outline rolled the swelling ocean all of gold ⁠though hoary showed the spray gay

⁠he feasts his hungry gaze and high upon his shoulders rears the fame and fates of unborn years while elsewhere thus the war proceeds saturnian juno swiftly speeds ⁠her iris from above to valiant turnus turnus then was sitting in a hallowed glen ⁠his sire pilumnus grove and thus the child of thaumas speaks heavens beauty flushing in her cheeks turnus what never god would dare to promise to his suppliants prayer lo here the lapse of time has brought een to your hands unasked unsought æneas camp and fleet forsakes and journey to evander takes nor thus content his way has found to far cortonas utmost bound the lydian people calls to arms and musters all the rustic swarms why longer wait the moment flies call horse and car the camp surprise een as she spoke her wings she spread and skyward on her rainbow fled the ardent youth the goddess knew ⁠his hands to heaven he rears and thus pursues her as from view ⁠aloft she disappears fair iris glory of the sky who sent thee hither from on high ⁠what means this sudden light i see the heavens dispart in twain and round the pole the starry train ⁠is swimming in my sight enough i follow this thy sign whoeer thou art o power divine so speaking to the wave he hied scooped in his palms the brimming tide in suppliance to the immortals bows and burdens heaven with uttered vows ⁠and now the host is on the plain with steeds and gold and broidered grain messapus the front rank arrays the hinder tyrrheus sons obeys ⁠the midmost are by turnus led so rising in serene repose ⁠great ganges rears his sevenfold head so nile from off the champaign

roll ⁠fetch weapons man the walls see there the foe and one and all pour through the gates and fill the wall for such æneas last command ⁠what time he stood to go should chance meanwhile surprise his band to wage no conflict hand to hand but safe behind the rampart stand ⁠and thence direct the blow so now though shame and scornful rage quick blending prompt them to engage they act his bidding close the gate and armed in sheltering towers await ⁠the coming of the foe turnus with twice ten chosen horse outstrips his columns tardy course ⁠and nears them unforeseen a thracian steed he rides whiteflecked with auburn crest his helm is decked ⁠itself of golden sheen and gallants who with me will dare the first assault he cries look there then sends his javelin through the air this the first drop of wars red rain and towerlike bears him oer the plain clamorous and eager to attack his comrades follow at his back the teucrian hearts they deem are slack ⁠their valour laid asleep they dare not trust the level space or fight as men do face to face ⁠but still the encampment keep so round and round the camp he wheels enraged and for an entrance feels like wolf who ranging round the fold whines at the gate in rain and cold ⁠at midnights season still safe neath their dams the lambkins bleat he rages in infuriate heat ⁠at those he cannot kill with hungers gathered flame unslaked and bloodless jaws to dryness baked thus while he wall and camp surveys the fire of wrath begins to blaze ⁠grief burns in every vein what way may access best be found to dash the trojans from their mound ⁠and fling them on the plain the fleet that lay upon their flank deep shored within the riverbank he first assails and calls aloud for torches to the exulting crowd and with a flaming pinetree brand himself on flame supplies his hand then then by turnus presence spurred they ply the work and at the word ⁠each waves a torch on fire the hearths are stripped and pitchy glare and soot and vapour through the air ⁠in flaky wreaths aspire ⁠what god ye muses stayed the fire and saved the barks from fate so dire declare the tale long since was told but fame is green though faith be old when first æneas on the height of ida built his ships for flight the berecyntine queen tis said her suit before the thunderer pled vouchsafe my son thy mothers prayer throned by her aid olympus heir on idas summit once was mine loved through long years a grove of pine where worshippers their homage paid with pitchtrees dark and maple shade these to the dardan chief i gave when ships he sought to cross the wave i gave and in the gift was glad but now their future makes me sad release me from my fears concede the object of a parents need grant that their texture neer may fail from voyage long or stormy gale such vantage let my favourites reap from birth on our idæan steep her son the mighty one replies who rolls the orbits of the skies o mother wherefore strive in vain the course of destiny to strain shall vessels made by mortal hand the immortals privilege command shall man ride safe in dangers hour claimed ever god so vast a power nay rather when their service oer they reach at length the ausonian shore what ships escaping wind and wave in latium land the dardan brave shall change their mortal shape for ours and swim the main as seagod powers as galatè and doto sweep oer the broad surface of the deep he said and called to seal his vow ⁠his stygian brothers lake the banks where pitch and sand and mud together mix their murky flood and with the bending of his brow ⁠made all olympus shake and now the promised time was come the fated years had filled their sum when turnus wrong reminds the dame to shield her sacred ships from flame a sudden light strikes blind their eyes a cloud runs westward oer the skies ⁠and idas choirs appear an awful voice through ether thrills the ranks of either army fills ⁠and deafens every ear forbear your weapons to employ to guard my ships ye sons of troy know turnus fire shall burn the seas or ere it touch my sacred trees go free my favourites loose your bands be oceannymphs your queen commands at once they burst their cords and dip like dolphins each with brazen tip ⁠down plunging neath the flood then all in maiden forms emerge swim out to sea and breast the surge as many as on the rivers verge ⁠had erst in order stood ⁠in wonder gaze the rutule crowd messapus valiant self is cowed ⁠his horses start and leap the river falters sounding hoarse old tiber and retracks his course ⁠nor hurries to the deep yet turnus still is undismayed still prompt to cheer or to upbraid at troy at troy these portents aim ⁠see jove has taen away the means of flight her wonted game for rutule sword and rutule flame ⁠her navy will not stay no path for her across the sea she has no hope to scape us she ⁠one half her world is gone ourselves are masters of the land such multitudes beside us stand ⁠italians every one they scare not me those words of heaven the voice of fate from temples given ⁠which phrygias exiles boast venus and fate have reaped their due in bringing safe the wandering crew ⁠to our ausonian coast i too have had my fate assigned to sweep the miscreants from mankind ⁠who rob me of my spouse not only atreus sons can feel nor greece alone can draw the steel ⁠for breach of marriage vows yet once to suffer may suffice what ailed them then to trespass twice one taste of crime should leave behind a loathing for the female kind behold their confidence they ground on balking trench and mediate mound ⁠removed from death a span and saw they not sink down in flame their iliums walls albeit the frame ⁠of powers more strong than man but you my warriors who will dare rush on with me the fence downtear ⁠the trembling camp invade no vulcans arms no thousand sail gainst troy are needed to prevail nay let etruria weight the scale ⁠and lend them all her aid palladium ravished from the tower its warders stabbed at midnights hour ⁠such feats they need not fear we will not skulk in horses womb our fires shall wrap their walls with doom ⁠in daylight broad and clear trust me they shall not think to say they deal with danaans weak as they whom hectors prowess kept at bay ⁠een to the tenth long year and now since days best hours are spent let deeds well done your hearts content recruit your weary frames and know the morn shall see us strike the blow ⁠meanwhile messapus has to set about the gates a living net ⁠and kindle fires around twice seven rutulian chiefs he calls armed watch to keep beside the walls a hundred youths each chief obey their helmets shoot a golden ray ⁠with crests of purple crowned they shift their posts relieve the guard then stretch them on the grassy sward to bacchus open all their soul and tilt full oft the brazen bowl throughout the night the watchfires flame and all is revel noise and game forth look the trojans from their mound they see the leaguer stretching round ⁠and keep the rampart manned in anxious fear the gates inspect with bridges wall and tower connect ⁠and muster spear in hand bold mnestheus and serestus brave to whose tried hands æneas gave should aught arise of sterner need to rule the state the battle lead ⁠press on now here now there along the walls the gathered host keeps tireless watch from post to post ⁠each taking dangers share ⁠nisus was guardian of the gate no bolder heart in wars debate the son of hyrtacus whom ide sent with his quiver at his side from hunting beasts in mountain brake to follow in æneas wake with him euryalus fair boy none fairer donned the arms of troy his tender cheek as yet unshorn and blossoming with youth newborn love made them one in every thought in battle side by side they fought and now onerrata duty at the gate the twain in common station wait can it be heaven said nisus then that lends such warmth to hearts of men or passion surging past control that plays the god to each ones soul long time impatient of repose my swelling heart within me glows and yearns its energy to fling on war or some yet grander thing see there the foe with vain hope flushed their lights are scant their stations hushed unnerved by slumber and by wine their bravest chiefs are stretched supine now to my doubting thought give heed and listen where its motions lead our trojan comrades one and all cry loud æneas to recall and where they say the men to go and let him of our peril know now if the meed i ask they swear to give you—nay i claim no share ⁠content with bare renown— meseems beside yon grassy heap the way i well might find and keep ⁠to pallanteums town the youth returns while thirst of praise infects him with a strange amaze can nisus aim at heights so great nor take his friend to share his fate shall i look on and let you go alone to venture mid the foe not thus my sire opheltes versed in wars rude toil my childhood nursed when argive terror filled the air and troy was battling with despair nor such the lot my youth has tried in hardship ever at your side since great æneas liegeman sworn i followed fortune to her bourne here here within this bosom burns a soul that mere existence spurns and holds the fame you seek to reap though bought with life were bought full cheap ⁠not mine the thought brave nisus said to wound you with so base a dread so may great jove or whosoeer marks with just eyes how mortals fare protect me going and restore in triumph to your arms once more but if—for many a chance you wis besets an enterprise like this— if accident or power divine the scheme to adverse end incline your life at least i would prolong death does your years a deeper wrong leave me a friend to tomb my clay rescued or ransomed which you may or een that boon should chance refuse to pay the absent funeral dues nor let me cause so dire a smart to that devoted mothers heart who sole of all the matron train attends her darling oer the main nor cares like others to sit down an inmate of acestes town he answers brief your pleas are naught firm stands the purpose of my thought ⁠come stir we why so slow then calls the guards to take their place moves on by inisus pace with pace ⁠and to the prince they go ⁠all other creatures wheresoeer were stretched in sleep forgetting care troys chosen chiefs in high debate were pondering oer the reeling state what means to try or whom to speed to show æneas of their need there stand they midway in the field still hold the spear still grasp the shield when nisus and his comrade brave with eager tones admittance crave the matter high though time be lost the occasion well were worth the cost iulus hails the impatient pair bids nisus what they wish declare then spoke the youth chiefs lend your ears nor judge our proffer by our years the rutules sunk in wine and sleep have ceased their former watch to keep a stealthy passage have we spied where on the sea the gate opes wide the line of fires is scat and broke and thick and murky rolls the smoke give leave to seek in these dark hours æneas at evanders towers soon will you see us here again decked with the spoils of slaughtered men nor strangeerrata the road ourselves have seen the city hid by valleys green just dimly dawning and explored in hunting all the riverboard out spoke aletes old and grey ye gods who still are iliums stay no no ye mean not to destroy down to the ground the race of troy when such the spirit of her youth and such the might of patriot truth then as the tears roll down his face he clasps them both in strict embrace brave warriors what rewards so great for worth like yours to compensate from heaven and from your own true heart expect the largest fairest part the rest and at no distant day the good æneas shall repay nor he the royal youth forget through all his life the mighty debt nay hear me too ascanius cried whose life is with my fathers tied o nisus by the homegod powers we jointly reverence yours and ours the god of ancient capys line and vestas venerable shrine by these dread sanctions i appeal to you the masters of my weal o bring me back my sire again restore him and i feel no pain two massy goblets will i give rich sculptures

count already thine twelve female slaves at your desire twelve captives with their arms entire my sire shall give you and the plain that forms latinus own domain but you dear youth of worth divine whose blooming years are nearer mine here to my heart i take and choose my comrade for whateer ensues no glory will i eer pursue unmotived by the thought of you let peace or war my state befall thought word and deed you share them all the youth replied no after day this hours fair promise shall betray be fate but kind yet let me claim one favour more than all you name a mother in the camp is mine derived from priams ancient line no home in sicily or troy has kept her from her darling boy she knows not she the paths i tread i leave her now no farewell said by night and this your hand i swear a parents tears i could not bear vouchsafe your pity and engage to solace her unchilded age and i shall meet whateer betide by such assurance fortified with sympathy and tender grief all melt in tears iulus chief as filial love in other shown recalled the semblance of his own and tell your doubting heart he cries all blessings wait your high emprise i take your mother for my own creusa save in name alone nor lightly deem the affection due to her who bore a child like you come what come may i plight ray troth by this my head my fathers oath the bounty to yourself decreed should favouring gods your journey speed the same shall in your line endure to parent and to kin made sure he spoke and weeping still untied a gilded falchion from his side lycaons work the man of crete with sheath of ivory complete brave mnestheus gives for nisus wear a lions hide with shaggy hair aletes old in danger grown his helmet takes and gives his own then to the gates as forth they fare the band of chiefs with many a prayer ⁠the gallant twain attends iulus manlier than his years oft whispering for his fathers ears ⁠full many a message sends but be it message be it prayer alike tis lost dispersed in air ⁠the trenches past through nights deep gloom ⁠the hostile camp they near yet many a foe shall meet his doom ⁠or ere that hour appear there see they bodies stretched supine oercome with slumber and with wine the cars unhorsed are drawn up high twixt wheels and harness warriors lie with arms and goblets on the grass in undistinguishable mass now nisus cries for hearts and hands this this the hour our force demands here pass we yours the rear to mind lest hostile arm be raised behind myself will go before and slay while carnage opes a broad highway so whispers he with bated breath and straight begins the work of death ⁠on rhamnes haughty lord on rugs he lay in gorgeous heap from all his bosom breathing sleep a royal seer by turnus loved but all too weak his seercraft proved ⁠to stay the rushing sword three servants next the weapon found stretched mid their armour on the ground then remus charioteer he spies beneath the coursers as he lies ⁠and lops his downdropt head the illstarred master next he leaves a headless trunk that gasps and heaves forth spouts the blood from every vein and deluges with crimson rain ⁠green earth and broidered bed then lamyrus and lamus died serranus too in youths fair pride that night had seen him long at play now by the dreamgod tamed he lay ah had his play but matched the night nor ended till the dawn of light so famished lion uncontrolled makes havoc through the teeming fold ⁠as frantic hunger craves mangling and harrying far and near the meek mild victims mute with fear ⁠with gory jaws he raves nor less euryalus performs the thirst of blood his bosom warms mid nameless multitudes he storms herbesus fadus abaris kills slumbering and witless of their ills while rhœtus wakes and sees the whole but hides behind a massy bowl there as to rise the trembler strove deep in his breast the sword he drove and bathed in death withdrew the lips disgorge the lifes red flood a mingled stream of wine and blood ⁠he plies his blade anew now turns he to messapus band ⁠for there the fires he sees burnt out while coursers hard at hand ⁠are browsing at their ease when nisus marks the excess of zeal the maddening fevererrata of the steel and checks him thus with brief appeal forbear we now twill soon be day our wrath is slaked and hewn our way full many a spoil they leave behind of solid silver thrice refined armour and bowls of costliest mould and rugs in rich confusion rolled a belt euryalus puts on with golden knobs from rhamnes won of old by cædicus twas sent an absent friendship to cement to remulus fair tiburs lord ⁠who dying to his grandson left the shining prize the rutule sword ⁠in after days the trophy reft athwart his manly chest in vain he binds these trappings of the slain then neath his chin in triumph laced messapus helm with plumage graced the camp at length they leave behind and round the lake securely wind ⁠meanwhile a troop is on its way ⁠from latiums city sped an offshoot from the host that lay along the plain in close array three hundred horsemen sent to bring a message back to turnus king ⁠with volscens at their head now to the camp they draw them nigh ⁠beneath the ramparts height when from afar the twain they spy ⁠still steering from the right the helmet through the glimmering shade at once the unwary boy betrayed ⁠seen in the moons full light not lost the sight on jealous eyes ho stand who are ye volscens cries ⁠whence come or whither tend no movement deign they of reply but swifter to the forest fly ⁠and make the night their friend with fatal speed the mounted foes each avenue as with network close ⁠and every outlet bar it was a forest bristling grim with shade of ilex dense and dim thick brushwood all the ground oergrew the tangled ways a path ran through ⁠faint glimmering like a star the darkling boughs the cumbering prey euryaluss flight delay his courage fails his footsteps stray ⁠but nisus onward flees no thought he takes till now at last the enemy is all oerpast een at the grove since alban called where then latinus herds were stalled sudden he pauses looks behind in eager hope his friend to find ⁠in vain no friend he sees euryalus my chiefest care where left i you unhappy where what clue may guide my erring tread this leafy labyrinth back to thread then noting each remembered track he thrids the wood dimseen and black listening he hears the horsehoofs beat the clatter of pursuing feet a little moment—shouts arise and lo euryalus he spies whom now the foemens gathered throng is hurrying helplessly along while vain resistance he essays trapped by false night and treacherous ways what should he do what force employ to rescue the beloved boy plunge through the spears that line the wood and death and glory win with blood not unresolved he poises soon a javelin looking to the moon grant goddess grant thy present aid queen of the stars latonian maid ⁠the greenwoods guardian power if grateful for success of mine with gifts my sire has graced thy shrine if eer myself have brought thee spoil the tribute of my hunters toil to ornament thy roof divine ⁠or glitter on thy tower these masses give me to confound and guide through air my random wound he spoke and hurled with all his might the swift spear hurtles through the night stout sulmos back the stroke receives the wood though snapped the midriff cleaves he falls disgorging lifes warm tide and longdrawn sobs distend his side all gaze around another spear the avenger levels from his ear ⁠and launches on the sky tagus lies pierced through temples twain the dart deep buried in his brain fierce volscens storms yet finds no foe nor sees the hand that dealt the blow ⁠nor knows on whom to fly your hearts warm blood for both shall pay he cries and on his beauteous prey ⁠with naked sword he sprang scared maddened nisus shrieks aloud no more he hides in nights dark shroud ⁠nor bears the oerwhelming pang me guilty me make me your aim rutules mine is all the blame he did no wrong nor eer could do that sky those stars attest tis true love for his friend too freely shown this was his crime and this alone in vain he spoke the sword fierce driven that alabaster breast had riven down falls euryalus and lies in deaths enthralling agonies blood trickles oer his limbs of snow his head sinks gradually low thus severed by the ruthless plough ⁠dim fades a purple flower their weary necks so poppies bow ⁠oerladen by the shower but nisus on the midmost flies with volscens volscens in his eyes in clouds the warriors round him rise ⁠thick hailing blow on blow yet on he bears no stint no stay like thunderbolt his falchions sway till as for aid the rutule shrieks plunged in his throat the weapon reeks the dying hand has reft away ⁠the lifeblood of its foe then pierced to death asleep he fell on the dead breast he loved so well blest pair if aught my verse avail no day shall make your memory fail ⁠from off the heart of time while capitol abides in place the mansion of the æneian race and throned upon that moveless base ⁠romes father sits sublime ⁠with conquest crowned of trophies proud the rutule warriors weeping loud ⁠slain volscens campward bring nor fewer tears in camp are shed for rhanmes and serranus dead by one fell stroke their noblest sped ⁠to darkness chief and king crowds gather to the spot where lie the bodies dead or soon to die and see the place afloat with blood and frothing gore in many a flood from hand to hand they pass the spoil ⁠messapus helm they know and trappings gay with deadly toil ⁠recovered from the foe ⁠now rising from tithonus bed the dawn oer earth her radiance spread when all is flooded by the ray and nature lies exposed to day bold turnus armed from head to heel inflames the warriors martial zeal each to his followers makes appeal ⁠and goads them to engage moreover fixed on lifted spears where in that hour were human tears two gory heads they thrust to view euryalus and nisus too ⁠with cries of hate and rage troys iron sons array their fight on the left rampart—for the right ⁠adjoins the river shore— above their breadth of moat they stood in lofty turrets sad of mood and horror on their spirit fell to see those heads they knew so well ⁠dripping with loathly gore ⁠through the pale ranks ran winged fame and swiftly to the mother came of lost euryalus the start sent icy chillness to her heart the thread was on the shuttle stopped and from her hand the spindle dropped she rends her hair she shrieks aloud and to the rampart and the crowd ⁠in wild distraction flies no more the face of men she fears the winged deaths the showering spears ⁠but fills the air with cries euryalus returned and thus ⁠and could you leave me lone mine ages stay in lifes late day ⁠o what a heart of stone this perilous adventure seek nor farewell to your mother speak and you are lying lying thrown to dogs and birds neath skies unknown— and i your mother might not close your glassy eyes your limbs compose ⁠nor wash the gore away nor robe you in that mantle fair which solacing an old wifes care i hastened for my darlings wear ⁠still spinning night and day where shall i seek you how reclaim those headless limbs that mangled frame this all and was it this ah me i followed over land and sea o slay me rutules if ye know a mothers love on me bestow ⁠the tempest of your spears or thou great thunderer pity take and whelm me neath the stygian lake since otherwise i may not break ⁠this life of bitter tears that wail the hearts of troy congealed ⁠from rank to rank the infection ran each sickens of the battlefield ⁠and feels no longer man still raves the miserable dame still higher piles griefs frantic flame iulus shedding tears like rain and old ilioneus call their train and actor and idæus come and bear her from the rampart home ⁠now shrills the trump its dire alarms at once the warriors cry to arms ⁠heaven thunders back the note the volscian host a penthouse form and strive the palisade to storm ⁠and choke the gaping moat some try the approach and ladders plant where most the battleline looks scant and the dark ring that crowns the wall presents a glimmering interval with equal zeal the sons of troy stout poles and missile darts employ taught by experience long and hard how best a leaguered wall to guard stones too with cruel weight they throw in hope to break the shielded foe sure on such fence the heaviest blow ⁠must fall like idle hail see see at length it yields it yields where threats the densest mass of shields a rock the trojans topple oer down on the rutule host it bore dashed wide their ranks behind before ⁠and burst their quilted mail cowed by the shock the rutules bold no more engage in fight blindfold but with a missile tempest strive the foeman from his wall to drive elsewhere mezentius grim to see wields tuscan pinestock tall as he and heads the desperate attack with torchfire vapours pitchy black while bold messapus neptunes seed imperious tamer of the steed tears down the palisade and calls for ladders to ascend the walls ⁠now grant calliope thine aid ⁠ye muses prompt my lay to tell what havoc turnus made ⁠on that too bloody day what gallant chiefs were hurled below and what the hands that dealt the blow be near and help me to unrol in length and breadth the martial scroll linked by strong bridges to the wall ⁠there rose a lofty tower italias warriors one and all assail it bent to work its fall ⁠with utmost strain of power the sons of troy with stones defend and through the narrowed eyelets send ⁠a furious steely shower fierce turnus first a firebrand flings it strikes the side takes hold and clings the freshening breezes spread the blaze and soon on plank and beam it preys the inmates flutter in dismay ⁠and vainly wish to fly there as they huddle and retire back to the part which scapes the fire sudden the oerweighted mass gives way ⁠and falling shakes the sky heavily to the ground they come ⁠in piteous ruin trailed some pierced with falling fragments some ⁠on their own darts impaled unhurt helenor sole of all and lycus issue from the fall helenor whom licymnia bare to lydias king a captive fair and sent herself her blooming boy in interdicted arms to troy trained up a naked sword to wield and bear a blank unblazoned shield soon as the rutule hosts he found and turnus squadrons close him round as beast by hunter crowds beset makes furious war on dart and net full at the throat of danger flies and spiked on serried javelins dies so leaps the warrior on the foe where storms of iron deadliest blow not so young lycus swifter far he threads the windings of the war gripes the high wall with talon clutch and strives his comrades hands to touch with speed of foot and javelins throw fierce turnus follows on the foe poor fool couldst hope the conqueror cries to baffle turnus of his prize then grasps him hanging and withal plucks down a bulwark from the wall so joves fell bird bears off in air a snowwhite swan or timorous hare so from its vainly bleating dam tears the gaunt wolf the folded lamb loud clamours rise they charge once more break down the mound the trench bridge oer or to the topmost rampart throw their brands of pinewood all aglow there as lucetius nears the gate ⁠and waves aloft the hostile flame ilioneus whelms him neath the weight ⁠of rock that from a mountain came stout liger brings emathion low ⁠asilas corynæus slays that skilled the warlike lance to throw this wings the arrow from the bow ⁠through unsuspected ways ortygius lies by cæneus slain ⁠the victor yields to turnus hands and sagaris itys clonius fall with promolus by turnus all and idas tumbled to the plain ⁠as on the wall he stands privernus finds from capys death ⁠themillas spear had grazed him first he flings his buckler on the ground and claps his hand upon the wound fond wretch the arrow wings the wind and to his side his hand is pinned and through the vital springs of breath ⁠a deadly passage burst there arceus son stood richly dight in broidered scarf with purple bright sent by his father to the fight ⁠a youth of glorious show reared in his oread mothers wood beside symæthus gentle flood where day by day with victims blood ⁠palicus altars flow no more his spear mezentius hurled thrice round his head his sling he whirled ⁠with shrill and whizzing sound sheer through the warriors temples sped with fatal aim the glowing lead he falls and lies unnerved and dead oer many a foot of ground then first they say ascanius tried ⁠in battlefield his bow till then gainst flying silvans plied ⁠and laid numanus low he late to his connubial bed had turnus youngest sister led and now of newworn purple proud he stalks erect with vaunting loud arid thus before the battles van with wordy turbulence began twice captured phrygians to be pent once more in leaguered battlement and plant unblushingly between yourselves and death a stony screen lo these the men that draw their swords to part our ladies from their lords what god what madness brings you here to taste of our italian cheer no proud atridæ lead our vans no false ulysses talks and plans een from the birth a hardy brood we take our infants to the flood and fortify their tender mould with icy wave and ruthless cold early and late our sturdy boys seek through the woods a hunters joys their pastime is to tame the steed to bend the bow and launch the reed our youth to scanty fare inured made strong by labour oft endured subdue the soil with spade and rake or city walls with battle shake through life we grasp our trusty spear it strikes the foe it goads the steer age cannot chill our valour no the helmet sits on locks of snow and still we love to store our prey and eat the fruits our arms purvey you flaunt your robes in all mens eyes your saffron and your purple dyes recline on downy couch or weave the dreamy dance from morn to eve sleeved tunics guard your tender skins and ribboned mitres prop your chins phrygians—nay rather phrygian fair hence to your dindymus repair go where the flutes congenial throat shrieks through two doors its slender note where pipe and cymbal call the crew these are the instruments for you leave men like us in arras to deal nor bruise your lily hands with steel that ominous tongue that boastful heart ⁠ascanius could not bear he drew the bowstring poised the dart and stood with outstretched arms apart ⁠first calling jove in prayer vouchsafe to bless great sire divine ⁠thy suppliants bold essay my grateful hand before thy shrine ⁠shall yearly offerings pay a goodly bullock from the stall snowwhite his mother scarce so tall ⁠shall at thy altar stand his horns which gold shall overlay een now anticipate the fray ⁠his feet spurn up the sand jove heard and instant from the left ⁠he thundered through the blue instant the bow was heard to twang the shaft along the welkin sang numanus haughty head it cleft ⁠and pierced his temples through go vent on worth your idle taunts such answer to rutulian vaunts ⁠twice captuted phrygians send ascanius spoke the sons of troy mount skyward in their rapturous joy ⁠and heaven with shoutings rend phœbus that hour from heavens dim height surveyed the fortunes of the fight and thus from off his throne of cloud bespoke the youthful victor proud tis thus that men to heaven aspire go on and raise your glories higher of gods the son of gods the sire beneath assaracuss seed the warworn land shall cease to bleed nor may our narrow troy contain the compass of so grand a reign so speaking from the skies he darts the fluttering air before him parts and quickly to ascanius hies in butes venerable guise once butes kept anchises door anchises arms in battle bore now other cares his age employ the guardian of the princely boy so moves the god voice colour all the veterans lineaments recall the silvery honours of his head his armour resonant with dread and thus with words of mild control he calms that young ambitious soul enough æneas son to know your hand unharmed with shaft and bow ⁠numanus life has taen such glory to your first of fields your patron god ungrudging yields nor robs of praise the arms he wields ⁠from farther fight refrain so phœbus speaks and speaking flies one moment beams on mortal eyes then mingles with the ambient skies the dardan chiefs the godhead knew his flashing weapons caught their view they heard his quiver as he flew so now at great apollos beck ascanius martial zeal they check themselves renew the doubtful strife and freely jeopardy their life rings through the camp the warshouts peal they bend their bows and hurl the steel ⁠which leathern thong reclaims spent javelins all the ground bestrow helmet and shield rebound the blow ⁠a savage fight upflames so furiously from westward sped the kidstar lowering overhead ⁠wild tempests lash the plain so on the sea the hail falls fast when jove dread lord of southern blast his watery volleys flings broadcast ⁠and opes the springs of rain ⁠pandarus and bitias brethren twain descended of alcanors strain iæra bore them nymph divine their stature matched the hillside pine ⁠or een the hills own height throw wide the gate they held in charge and trusting but to spear and targe ⁠the foes advance invite themselves within the gateway stand fronting the towers on either hand magnificent in steel array ⁠and toss their plumes on high so two fair oaks that proudly grow on banks of athesis or po their unshorn heads aloft display ⁠and tower into the sky with eager joy the rutules see the gates thrown wide the entrance free ⁠and pour by hundreds in full soon aquicolus the fair with quercens hæmon fiery tmare to flight with all their followers turn or with their heels the threshold spurn ⁠but now they thought to win fierce and more fierce the combat glows in gathering ranks the trojans close ⁠nor further onset wait but foot to foot defy their foes ⁠and press beyond the gate ⁠meanwhile to turnus as afar on other parts he launches war ⁠and mars the foes array comes word that flushed with blood newshed the sons of troy forget their dread ⁠and wide their gates display fell rage inspiring all his mind the unfinished work he leaves behind and rushes to the gates amain to cope with that presumptuous twain first on antiphates he bore whom chance had planted in the fore the great sarpedons spurious seed born of a dame of theban breed the cornel hurtles through the skies straight to the stomachs pit it flies and lodges neath the bosoms core while the dark cavern wells with gore then merops erymas the brave and young aphidnus find a grave and bitias as with eyes aglow and bursting rage he fronts his foe no dart was thrown a puny dart had scarcely reached that giant heart no twas a huge falaric spear thundering in levinlike career ⁠that left the victors hand not two bullhides nor corslet mail though plaited twice with golden scale ⁠the onset might withstand the vast frame tumbles on the field groans the jarred earth loud clangs the shield tis thus descends in later day the granite pile in baiæs bay ⁠compact of many a block een thus in mighty downfall sped it sinks into the oozy bed ⁠with vast reverberant shock up mounts the sand from depths profound lone prochyta perceives the sound ⁠thrill deep through cave and rock and arime by joves behest firm fixed on typhons monster breast ⁠now mars omnipotent imparts fresh vigour to the latian hearts ⁠while on the trojan band dark fear he sends and coward flight the italians claim the proffered fight ⁠and fury nerves each hand when pandarus saw his brother slain and knew the tide had ebbed again he sets his shoulders to the gate and backward rolls the enormous weight leaving in miserable rout full many a hapless friend shut out while others through the entrance pour and saved from carnage breathe once more fond fool amidst the noise and din he saw not turnus rushing in but closed him in the embattled hold a tiger in a helpless fold from those fierce eyes new terrors blaze ⁠his arms around him clash the red plume on his helmet plays and from his shield reflected rays ⁠like living lightning flash at once the trembling trojans know the dreaded presence of their foe ⁠but pandarus onward flies in his proud breast his brothers fate awakes the flames of rage and hate ⁠and thus in scorn he cries not this amatas promised dower your royal dome your bridal bower nor ardeas native town enthralls her turnus in her friendly walls a hostile camp around you see shut in without the power to flee then turnus with untroubled mien begin and let your strength be seen soon shall you tell in priams ear you found a new achilles here strong pandarus launches on the wind a knotted spear unpeeled its rind ⁠with mighty effort flung saturnia caught it as it came and turned it from its destined aim ⁠fixed in the gate it hung not thus shall err my trusty brand sped by a surer stronger hand then rising tiptoe as he speaks ⁠turnus uplifts the falchion keen with force resistless sweeping down it crashes on the warriors crown and ample brows and beardless cheeks ⁠are severed clear and clean at once the mighty ruin sounds the firm earth trembles and rebounds his armour splashed with blood and brain his giant members load the plain on either shoulder cleft in twain ⁠the ghastly head is seen the trojans fly in wild dismay ⁠o then had turnus thought to force the fastenings of the gates and call within his valiant mates the nation and the war that day ⁠alike to end had brought but rage and blind desire to slay still drive him on the recreant prey first phalaris beneath him dies and gyges hamstrung as he flies forth from the slain he plucks each spear and hurls them on the fliers rear while juno nerves him for the strife and breathes within diviner life then lays he halys on the field and phegeus cloven through his shield alcander halius prytanis ⁠and young noemon all are slaughtered ere their foe they wis ⁠and tumbled from the wall and lynceus who in vain essayed the strife and called his friends for aid his right knee propped against the mound he swings his weighty falchion round headpiece and head by one sure wound ⁠cut off at distance fall then huntsman amycus succeeds none better knew to flying reeds ⁠the envenomed point to lend and clytius feels the conquerors spear and cretheus to the muses dear ⁠cretheus the muses friend the minstrel lay the tuneful shell had touched him with their magic spell ⁠and still the warrior strung to martial themes his glowing lyre and arms and men and steeds of fire ⁠in lofty numbers sung ⁠at last at news of troys defeat mnestheus and brave serestus meet their friends they see in wild retreat ⁠within their camp the foe and whither fly ye mnestheus cried what walls what town are yours beside shall one more man on all sides pent within your mounded battlement such deaths have dealt such warriors sent ⁠unvenged to shades below feel ye no shame no manly grief for gods for country or for chief ⁠o craven hearts and slow roused by the word they stand at length and front him with collected strength while turnus by degrees gives ground and seeks the part the stream runs round the trojans follow shouting loud and closer still and closer crowd so when the gathering swains assail a lion with their brazen hail he glaring rage begins to quail ⁠and sullenly departs for shame his back he will not turn yet dares not howsoeer he yearn ⁠to charge their serried darts so turnus lingeringly retires and glows with ineffectual fires twice on the foe een then he falls twice routs and drives them round the walls but from the camp in swarms they pour nor juno dares to help him more ⁠for iris hastens down with words from jove of angry threat should turnus make resistance yet ⁠nor quit the leaguered town no longer now by force of hand or buckler may the youth withstand ⁠so thick the javelins play round his broad brows the helmet rings crushed by the volley from the slings ⁠its solid sides give way his

retrieves on rushes hisbo madly fain to catch him hampered with the slain ⁠but pallas still more fleet prevents him as with reckless zeal he breathes revenge and plants the steel ⁠een where the

brethren twain of daucus honourable strain so like the sweet confusion een ⁠their parents eyes betrayed but pallas twin and twin between ⁠has cruel difference made for thymbers head the steel has

obedient hear and parting leave the champaign clear thence as the yielding crowd retires the brave youth pauses and admires much marvels at his haughty phrase and scans his form with eager gaze then rolling round undaunted eyes with speech as resolute replies or goodly spoils shall make me great ⁠or honourable death my sire is nerved for either fate ⁠loud vaunts are empty breath he spoke and marched into the field chill fear the arcadian hearts congealed down plunges turnus from his car ⁠prepared on foot to fight as when a lion from afar beholds a bull intending war headlong he comes with furious bound so fierce advancing oer the ground ⁠looks turnus to the sight ⁠when pallas saw his foe advance within the cover of his lance he steps in front in hope that chance ⁠his illmatched powers may aid and thus with upraised countenance ⁠to highest heaven he prayed now by the board whose homely fare a stranger thou wast fain to share assist me hercules i pray in this my all too bold essay let turnus eyes in dying brook upon a conquerors face to look the while i spoil him as he lies of his stained arms my gory prize his votarys prayer alcides hears his cheeks are bathed in fruitless tears and deep within his labouring breast ⁠he heaves a stifled groan whom thus the almighty sire addressed ⁠in grave and soothing tone each has his destined time a span is all the heritage of man tis virtues part by deeds of praise to lengthen fame through after days full many a godheads son beside the walls of troy in combat died nay he my own authentic seed sarpedon he was doomed to bleed death waits for turnus too een now he nears the bound his fates allow so speaking be averts his mien and turns him from the deathful scene ⁠now pallas hurls with all his might his spear and bares his falchion bright where rising high the brazen coat the shoulder guards the javelin smote pierced the broad shield with wellmeant aim and grazed een turnus mighty frame then poising long the shaft at last his steeltipped javelin turnus cast and let it now he cries be seen if this my dart be not more keen so he through all the metal plates ⁠the hides of bullocks dressed that wrapped the shield in folds on folds the fatal point its passage holds the corslets barrier penetrates ⁠and cleaves his manly breast from the wide wound he plucks in vain ⁠the reeking weapon out the lifeblood and the life amain ⁠in mingled torrent spout he sinks collapsing on the wound about his limbs the arms resound and as he writhes in deadly pain his fierce teeth bite the hostile plain ⁠spanning the dead with haughty stride arcadians hear me turnus cried say to your monarch i remit his pallas handled as was fit the solace of a tomb the meed of burial freely i concede who to æneas plays the host must square the glory with the cost then with his foot the corpse he pressed and stripped the belt from off the breast the ponderous belt whose sculptured gold a tale of crime and bloodshed told those fifty bridegrooms slain in bed een on the very night they wed once clonus work now proudly worn by turnus in his hour of scorn o impotence of mans frail mind to fate and to the future blind presumptuous and oerweening still when fortune follows at its will full soon shall turnus wish in vain that life untouched those spoils untaen and think it cheap to spend his all could gold that bloody deed recall but pallas lifeless on his shield his weeping comrades bear from field o sad proud thought that thus a son ⁠should reach a fathers door this day beheld your wars begun ⁠this day beholds them oer the while you leave on yonder plain vast heaps of rutule warriors slain ⁠no random fame of ill so great but surer messenger of fate ⁠to brave æneas hies tells him the day is wellnigh lost tis time to aid the routed host ⁠while yet the moment flies with brandished sword he storms along and hews a passage through the throng still seeking turnus newly red with slaughter of the mighty dead pallas evander all they stand ⁠like life before his sight the board that welcomed him the hand ⁠in warm affiance plight four hapless youths of sulmos breed ⁠and four who ufens call their sire he takes alive condemned to bleed ⁠to pallas shade on pallas pyre at magus then his spear he threw but magus from the death withdrew came crouching up while oer his head the quivering lance through ether sped and clasped the victors knees and said by your great fathers shade i pray by young iulus dawning day in pity deign my life to spare for my gray sire my youthful heir a lofty house is mine a hoard of silver in its vaults is stored and piles of wrought and unwrought gold are treasured there of weight untold not here the crisis of the strife nor victory hangs on one poor life he ceased immoveable and stern æneas thus made brief return nay spare your gold and silver heap those treasured hoards your heirs should keep since turnus shed out pallas gore the bartery of war is oer so deems my gallant son and so my fathers spirit down below then seized him by the helm and smote with deepplunged blade his backdrawn throat not far hæmomdes the good apollos priest and dians stood his brow with sacred fillet wreathed his limbs in dazzling armour sheathed he meets him chases lays him low stands oer the immolated foe ⁠and shadows him like night serestus on his shoulders proud bears the bright arms a trophy

the hero wreaked his wrath came tarquitus athwart his path whom dryope to faunus bore refulgent armour cased him oer the dardan spear with force addressed drives shield and corslet on his breast then while in vain he pours his prayers and many a plea for life prepares his shapely neck the falchion shares down falls the body reft of head and thus æneas taunts the dead lie there proud youth no mother dear shall lay you on your fathers bier your corpse shall rot above the soil the eagles and the ravens spoil or drift unheeded down the flood while hungry fish shall lick your blood antæus next and lucas die the flower of turnus chivalry with numa cast in valours mould and camers with his locks of gold of noble volscens ancient strain who lord of many a wide domain oer mute amyclæ stretched his reign as when of old ægæon strove against the majesty of jove with fifty heads so legends say a hundred hands he waged the fray each head disgorged a stream of fire to match the lightnings of the sire each hand flashed forth a sword or pealed responsive thunder on the shield so when æneas blade was warmed oer all the plain at once he stormed now on niphæus fourhorse car and towering crest he turns the war soon as the advancing coursers spied that dreadful port that lofty stride appalled they start their lord unseat and backward to the shore retreat ⁠see lucagus and liger ride in one fair chariot side by side one brother skilled the reins to guide ⁠while one the falchion plies æneas stays their bold career confronts them with uplifted spear ⁠when thus proud liger cries not these the steeds of diomed ⁠nor this achilles car nor phrygias plains before you spread this land shall see the invader dead ⁠and terminate the war thus liger madly vaunts the foe speaks not but answers with a blow as lucagus low bends him oer ⁠the chariots rim his steeds to smite and with left foot advanced before ⁠prepares him for the doubtful fight just where the shields last sutures join comes the fell spear and strikes the groin he from his chariot overthrown down toppling on the field lies prone and thus in sharp contemptuous strain æneas glories oer the slain so friend no shadows seen from far have turned to flight your luckless car no frightened horses caused its shame its nimble lord is all to blame then on the steeds his hand he laid ⁠when sliding from the seat the wretched brother knelt and prayed ⁠a suppliant at his feet o by your own illustrious worth by those who gave such greatness birth brave chief of troy your suitor spare— the warrior stopped his further prayer not this the strain you breathed so late die brother should be brothers mate his sword unlocks the springs of breath and opes a way to let in death so plies the chief his work of blood through the wide field like torrent flood ⁠or black tempestuous wind ascanius and his leaguered train take heart and issue on the plain ⁠and leave their camp behind ⁠then jove addressed the spouse of jove sweet sister mine and wedded love who now will do your judgment wrong tis venus makes these trojans strong not those vain powers they deem are theirs the hand that strikes the soul that dares ah why she answered gracious sire torment a heart that fears your ire had i the power i owned erewhile the power that suits my queenly style ⁠i then had moved your will that turnus rescued from the strife should yet enjoy his precious life ⁠and bless old daunus still now let him die though just and good and glut his foes with guiltless blood yet from our race he draws his name from old pilumnus loins he came and altars crowned with offerings fair attest his worth and claim your care to whom in brief thus made reply the ruler of the etherial sky if all for turnus you would crave be respite from an open grave ⁠and so my mind you read let the doomed youth have space to fly and scape awhile his destiny ⁠so much may jove concede but know if neath your prayer you hide some deeper larger boon beside and think to change the wars set tide ⁠tis empty hope you feed the queen returns with streaming eyes ⁠what if your heart should give that further boon your lip denies ⁠and suffer him to live now on the blameless victim wait the powers of doom or blind to fate ⁠i wander all astray yet o may junos fears be vain and he that can in mercy deign ⁠to choose the better way ⁠then from the sky with eager haste she stoops a stormcloud round her waist and driving tempest as she flies down to the embattled hosts she hies a phantom in æneas mould she fashions wondrous to behold ⁠of hollow shadowy cloud bids it the dardan arms assume the shield the helmet and the plume gives soulless words of swelling tone and motions like the heros own ⁠as stately and as proud like gliding spectres of the dead or dreams that haunt the slumberers bed now stalking in the battles van the phantom menaces the man ⁠and pours defiant cries turnus comes on in swift career and hurls from far his hurtling spear ⁠when lo it turns and flies then turnus deems his foe retires in craven flight and instant fires ⁠with hopes delusive glow æneas why so fast he cried desert not thus your plighted bride the land you sought for oer the tide ⁠this hand shall soon bestow so clamouring he pursues the quest ⁠with brandished falchion bare nor sees the transports of his breast ⁠are lavished on the air a ship stood fastened to the bank with steps let

⁠æneas seeks his foe and hurries all that cross his path ⁠to dis and death below and now no more the phantom hides ⁠but melts in air on high while turnus oer the ocean rides ⁠fast as his bark can fly ⁠amazed unthankful for escape he gazes on the fleeting shape and thus in wild remonstrance cries with hands uplifted to the skies and couldst thou deem almighty sire thy worshippers offence so dire ⁠to merit doom so sore whence came i whither am i borne and must i journey home in scorn nor eer behold ah wretch forlorn ⁠the camp the city more and where are they that gallant band who fieldward

euanthes sinks beneath his spear and mimas paris loved compeer ⁠whom fair theano bore to amycus the selfsame night when troys fell firebrand sprang to light now paris neath his countrys walls sleeps his last sleep while mimas falls ⁠on latiums unknown shore like wild boar driven from mountain height by cries that scare and fangs that bite in vesulus pinecinctured glen long fostered or laurentums fen ⁠mid reeds and marish ground now trapped among the hunters nets his bristles rears his tushes whets none dares for very fear draw nigh with arrowy war and furious cry ⁠they stand at distance round een thus of all mezentius foes none ventures hand to hand to close with deafening shouts and bended bows ⁠their tyrant they assail he churning foam from side to side glares round and from his tough bull hide ⁠shakes off the brazen hail from ancient corythus domain had acron come of grecian strain ⁠leaving his spouse unwed him dealing death mezentius spied clad in the robe his lady dyed ⁠and crowned with plumage red as lion ranging oer the wold made mad by hunger uncontrolled if flying roe his eyes behold ⁠or loftyantlered deer grins ghastly rears his mane and hangs oer the rent flesh his greedy fangs ⁠dark streams of gore besmear so springs mezentius on the foe soon lies unhappy acron low spurns the soaked ground with dying heel and stains with blood the shivered steel now as orodes strides before he deigns not to shed out his gore ⁠by javelins covert blow he heads and meets him front to front not by base stealth but strengths sheer brunt ⁠prevailing oer his foe with spear infixed and scornful tread pressing the fallen the conqueror said behold the great orodes slain ⁠who stemmed the war so long and at the word his joyous train ⁠raise high the pæan song the chief replies whateer thy name ⁠not long shall be thy hour of pride the same dark powers thy presence claim ⁠and soon shall stretch thee at my side mezentius answers smiling stern die thou my fate is joves

⁠his forehead in the sky so towering high in steel array mezentius marches to the fray æneas marks him far away ⁠and hastes his mighty foe to meet firm stands the foe without dismay ⁠like mountain rooted to its seat then nicely measures with his eye the distance due for lance to fly now hear my prayer my spear steeltipped ⁠and thou my good right hand a votive trophy all equipped with spoils from yon false pirate stripped ⁠today shall lausus stand he spoke and forth his javelin threw from the broad shield apart it flew and piercing deep twixt side and flank in brave antores frame it sank antores follower in the train of hercules oer land and main who sped from argos sat him down copartner in evanders town now prostrate by an unmeant wound in death he welters on the ground and gazing on italian skies of his loved argos dreams and dies his javelin then æneas cast through triple plate of bronze it passed ⁠thick quilt and hide threefold till in the groin it lodged at last ⁠but might not further hold æneas sees with glistening eye ⁠the tuscans lifeblood flow plucks forth the falchion from his thigh ⁠and threats the wounded foe ⁠when lausus thus his sire beheld ⁠a heartfetched groan he drew hot tears within his eyelids swelled ⁠and trickled down in dew now let me glorious youth relate your gallant deeds your piteous fate should after days my labours own i will not leave you all unknown the sire encumbered and unstrung ⁠moves backward oer the field and trails the spear the trojan flung ⁠still dangling from his shield forth sprang the generous youth betwixt and fearless with the combat mixed een as æneas aimed a stroke with upraised arm its force he broke himself sustained the lifted blade and shield in hand the conqueror stayed loud clamouring the confederate train ⁠protect the sires retreat and on the foe at distance rain ⁠their driving arrowy sleet with gathering wrath æneas glows and cased in armour shuns the blows as when the hails chill stores descend ⁠in tempest from the skies each swain that wont the plough to tend ⁠to speedy covert flies the traveller hides his fenceless head in caverned rock or torrents bed till parting clouds restore the sun and man resumes the day begun so stands æneas neath the blast of wintry war till all be past and chiding threatening seeks to stay young lausus from his bold essay fond youth why rush so fast on fate and spend your strength on task too great love blinds you to impending ill— in vain the fond youth rages still and now more fierce the passions rise that lighten from the trojans eyes and lausus miserable thread the hand of fate at length must shred lo with full force æneas drives the weapon and his bosom rives through the light shield that made him bold the vest his mother wove with gold the blade held on his breast runs oer with gurgling rivulets of gore while to the phantom world away flits the sad soul and leaves the clay but when anchises son surveyed the fair fair face so ghastly made he groaned by tenderness unmanned and stretched the sympathizing hand as reproduced he sees once more the love that to his sire he bore alas what honour hapless youth to those great deeds that soul of truth ⁠can good æneas show keep the frail arms you loved to wear the lifeless corpse i yield to share if thought like this still claim your care ⁠your fathers tomb below yet take this solace to the grave twas great æneas hand that gave ⁠the inevitable blow with that he chides his friends delay and rears from earth the bleeding clay bedabbling as it lay with gore the dainty locks so trim before ⁠meantime the sire by tibers flood was staunching the yet flowing blood on trees broad bole recumbent stayed and sheltered by its kindly shade high on the branches hangs his casque his arms reposing from their task ⁠in meadowgrasses rest his mates stand round in friendly ring panting and weak the wounded king eases his faint neck scattering ⁠his beard adown his breast of lausus oft he asks and sends full many a charge by hand of friends ⁠to call him back from field alas een then the weeping train were bearing lausus oer the plain the mighty by the mighty slain ⁠and stretched upon his shield the distant wail prolonged and drear smote on the sires prophetic ear at once in bitterness of woe he mars with dust his locks of snow his hands to heaven despairing flings and fondly to the body clings my son and held i life so sweet that i your sire could let you meet ⁠for me the foemans steel by your last gasp preserve my breath kept living by my darlings death aye now is exiles woe complete ⁠now now my wound i feel dear child i stained your glorious name by my own crimes driven out to shame ⁠from my ancestral reign my countrys vengeance claimed my blood ah had that tainted guilty flood ⁠been shed from every vein now mid my kind i linger still and live but leave the light i will thus as he pours the bitter cry he rears him on his crippled thigh and though the deep wound slacks his speed calls proudly for his warrior steed the warrior steed he wont to ride his consolation and his pride which ever still at fall of night had borne him conqueror from the fight and thus bespeaks in kindly tone the beast whose sorrow matched his own long have we lived if long the date conferred on aught of mortal state now rhæbus will we twain today a glorious trophy bear away the trojans arms and severed head in vengeance for my lausus dead or if the vantage be denied we twain will perish side by side for neer i ween my gallant horse will soul so generous stoop perforce to other mastery nor deign that trojan hand should sleek thy mane he said and mounting to his selle pressed the proud sides he knew so well in either hand a javelin took and his plumed crest disdainful shook ⁠so rushed he on the foe while kindling in each throbbing vein a warriors pride a fathers pain ⁠with mingled madness glow three times he called æneas name æneas hears the loud acclaim ⁠and prays with fierce delight grant mighty jove apollo grant this challenge prove no empty vaunt ⁠begin begin the fight he said and with uplifted spear confronts the foe in mid career but he what means this threatening strain to fright me now my child is slain twas thus and thus alone your dart could eer have reached mezentius heart i fear not death nor ask to live nor quarter take from heaven nor give forbear i come to meet my end and these my gifts before me send he ceased and at the word he wings ⁠a javelin at the foe then circling round in rapid rings another and another flings ⁠the good shield bides each blow thrice fiercely hurling spears on spears ⁠from right to left he wheeled thrice facing round as he careers the steely grove the trojan bears ⁠thick planted on his shield at length impatient of delay wearied with plucking spears away indignant at the unequal fray ⁠his wary fence he leaves and issuing with resistless force the temples of the gallant horse ⁠with darted javelin cleaves the good steed rears and wildly sprawls ⁠distracted with its wound then heavily on the rider falls ⁠and pins him to the ground fierce shouts enkindling all the air ⁠from either host arise forth springs the chief with falchion bare ⁠and thus triumphant cries say where is proud mezentius now where sleep the terrors of his brow recovering sense with upturned eye the tuscan gasping made reply stern foe why waste your threatening breath he wrongs me not who works my death when late i dared you to the strife i made no covenant for life nor he my lausus eer such pledge extorted from your weapons edge one boon if vanquished foe may crave the victors grace i ask—a grave my wrathful subjects round me wait protect me from their savage hate and let me in the tomb enjoy the presence of my slaughtered boy he said and to the conquerors sword ⁠his throat unshrinking gave the lifeblood oer his armour poured ⁠spreads wide its crimson wave morn rose meantime from oceans bed æneas though his comrades dead ⁠his instant care invite still wildered by the bloody day yet hastes his votive dues to pay ⁠with dawn of earliest light an oak with branches lopped all round he plants upon a lofty mound ⁠and hangs with armour bright mezentius warrior panoply a glorious trophy vowed to thee ⁠great ruler of the fight there stands the helm besprent with gore the spent snapped darts in life he bore the hauberk mail whose twisted rows twelve ghastly apertyres disclose the buckler on the left is hung and from the neck the falchion strung then thus the conqueror addressed the exulting chiefs who round him pressed a mighty deed my friends is done ⁠the future craves no fear these spoils are from the tyrant won ⁠see battles firstfruits here behold the great mezentius stands the masterwork of these my hands now look to march where glory calls to king latinus and the walls let courage dream of deeds of might and dazzling hope forestall the fight so when at last in prosperous hour heaven bids us marshal forth our power no ignorance shall breed delay no coward fears our onset stay now turn we to our comrades slain the mighty dead that load the plain and pay to each the rites we owe the sole sad joy that spectres know haste we he cries consign to earth the flesh that clothed those souls of worth who gave their precious lives to win this land of ours for us their kin first send we to evanders town brave pallas heir of high renown whose hopeful day has set too soon oercast by darkness ere its noon ⁠so spake he dropping tears like dew ⁠then sought the tent again where old acœtes liegeman true ⁠was watching oer the slain acœtes who in times of yore evanders arms in battle bore since called by fate less kind to tend the royal heir his guide and friend the gathered menials round him stand and dames of troy a mourning band ⁠their flowing locks unbound soon as æneas meets their sight they shriek to heaven their breasts they smite ⁠the walls return the sound there when he saw the pillowed head the bloodless features of the dead and on the ivory breast displayed the wound that turnus javelin made once more the pitying tear he shed ⁠and words their utterance found unhappy youth and can it be ⁠that fortune in her happier hour has grudged you to partake with me ⁠the spectacle of new won power and homeward ride in conquering car triumphant from the field of war not such the oath i swore that day to your lorn father old and grey when ere he sped me on my way ⁠he clasped my hand in fond embrace and warned me fierce would prove the fray ⁠and stern the temper of the race een now perchance by hope beguiled he makes oblation for his child ⁠and calls on heaven to save we sadly render to the shade whose every debt to heaven is paid ⁠the due that spectres crave tis yours illfated to behold the son you look for dead and cold is this our proud procession these our triumphs boasted pageantries ⁠and this the pledge i gave but not from field of battle chased by ignominious wounds disgraced ⁠your darling shall return nor you his father pray for death to stop your scant remains of breath ⁠while he survives in scorn mourn sad ausonia mourn thy fate left of thy guardian desolate ⁠and thou iulus mourn ⁠his wailing oer he gives command ⁠to raise the mournful load and bids a thousand of his band ⁠attend its homeward road with charge to comfort and condole weak cordial to the fathers soul ⁠yet such as friendship owed while others weave without delay of oaken branch and arbute spray a funeral bier and deftly spread soft leaves above the pliant bed there high on rural couch displayed the body of the youth is laid so cropped by maidens finger lies ⁠a hyacinth or violet its graceful mould its glowing dyes ⁠undimmed unwasted yet though parent earth afford no more the vital juice it drank before next brings the chief two mantles fair ⁠deep dyed with dazzling red phœnicias hapless queen whilere so prodigal of loving care had wrought them for her heros wear ⁠and pranked with golden thread full soon with one the lifeless frame ⁠in funeral guise he wound the tresses that must feed the flame ⁠with one he muffled round then at his word in long array the attendants marshal forth the prey memorials of laurentums fray and weapons from the foeman taen and fiery chargers swell the train there walk with hands fast bound behind the victim prisoners designed ⁠for slaughter oer the flames and mighty warriors march erect neath trunks with arms of foemen decked ⁠and marked with hostile names then sad acœtes worn with years ⁠moves on by others led his breast he beats his cheeks he tears ⁠and rolls on earth outspread there too is seen the dead mans car bloodsprinkled from rutulian war then æthon comes his trappings doffed ⁠the warriors gallant horse big drops of pity oft and oft ⁠adown his visage course in sad procession others bring the lance and helm the rutule king ⁠is lord of all but those and teucrian tuscan arcad bands their spears inverted in their hands ⁠the mournful pageant close now as the train at length goes by æneas speaks with deepdrawn sigh fate calls us other tears to shed ⁠and we must needs obey hail mighty firstling of the dead ⁠hail and farewell for aye then turns him back the greeting said ⁠and campward takes his way ⁠now from laurentums town appear ⁠ambassadors sedate and grave thick olive boughs in hand they bear ⁠and for indulgence crave be burial granted to the slain whose mangled bodies load the plain no war may soldier wage they say with vanquished men and senseless clay who once his hosts his kin were styled should find him een in victory mild the good æneas owns their plea and thus bespeaks them courteously what mischief latians makes you slight our proffered love and plunge in fight ask ye that war in death may cease fain would i grant the living peace i had not sought you but the voice of oracles compelled my choice fate bade me here my city place nor war i with the latian race no twas your king forsook his word and turnus arms to mine preferred if turnus waked the flames of strife twere just that turnus risked his life to end the war by force of hand and drive the trojans from the land if such his boast his part had been to meet me here with blade as keen and he had lived who won the right from favouring gods or inborn might go now prepare the funeral pyre and give your hapless friends to fire ⁠he ended wildered with amaze in silence each on each they gaze then drances he whose age pursued the daunian youth with bitter feud still prompt injurious taunts to fling makes answer to dardanias king o great in fame in deeds more great what eloquence your worth can mate say which may first our praise demand the just mans heart the brave mans hand soon shall this grateful train convey back to our peers the words you say and let but chance the means afford unite you to our gracious lord should turnus gainsay or deny let turnus seek some new ally nay latiums sons shall spend their pains to build the walls your fate ordains and nerve and sinew task with joy in shouldering up the stones of troy so drances spoke and all the rest with loud acclaim their mind expressed for twice six days a truce is fixed and there while concord reigns betwixt teucrian and latin freely mixed ⁠oer hill and woodland stray the sharp axe rings upon the ash heavenkissing elms in ruin crash the forceful wedge with stroke on stroke splits cedarn core and heart of oak and bullocks groaning neath the yoke ⁠bear the full wains away ⁠now fame sad harbinger of grief comes flying to the arcadian chief and fills with doleful trumpet blast ⁠the palace and the town fame whose shrill voice a moment past had told the tale of slaughter vast ⁠and pallas young renown swift through the gate arcadias bands pour forth with torches in their hands ⁠so ancient rule ordains the highway glimmers sadly bright one line of long funereal light ⁠that parts the dusky plains now marching mournfully along the phrygians join their wailing throng the matrons see the crowd draw nigh and rend the heaven with piercing cry no force can old evander stay with breathless haste he takes his way and falling on the rested bier hangs oer his child with groan and tear at last the refluent ware of woe gives scanty room for speech to flow o pallas parting from your sire ⁠far other pledge you gave to moderate your martial fire ⁠nor wars worst fury brave i knew the young bloods maddening play the charm of battles first essay o valour blighted in the flower o first dread drops of wars full shower o prayers unheard rejected vows and thou my lost my sacred spouse blest in thy death nor spared to see this uttermost calamity while i have overlived my span to linger on a childless man ah had i joined the dardan train and fallen by rutule javelins slain and this your escort of the dead conveyed me home in pallas stead nor you ye trojans i upbraid the faith we swore the league we made a lot like this of hopeless tears was due to my declining years if early death was his decreed twas comfort that he thus should bleed as troy to latiums walls he led through fields his arm with death had spread nor een for you dear child could sire a worthier sepulture desire than this which good æneas deigns in honour to your loved remains where phrygias mightiest shed the tear and all etruria tends the bier proud trophies to your praise they yield the chiefs you tumble on the field thou turnus too hadst swelled his fame ⁠a mighty trunk with armour hung had time but made his years the same ⁠his arm with equal vigour strung but why with helpless wail delay a host impatient for the fray go to your gallant prince remit my charge upon your memory writ if thus bereaved i linger yet tis from your hand to claim my debt the life of turnus doubly due to pallas and his father too this niche alone is vacant still for fortune and desert to fill not now to glad this life of mine i ask—forbid it powers divine no down to darkness i would bear the joy and with my darling share ⁠meantime the gracious dawn displays to wretched men her genial rays ⁠and calls to work once more stout tarchon and the trojan sire are rearing many a funeral pyre ⁠along the winding shore here as his countrys rites ordain each brings his brave compatriots slain and while the dusk flames mount on high a veil of darkness shrouds the sky thrice ride they round each lighted pyre ⁠encased in glittering mail thrice circle the funereal fire ⁠and raise their piercing wail earth armour all with tears arc dewed and warrior shouts and clarions rude ⁠the vault of heaven assail there others on the embers throw rich booty reft from slaughtered foe the helm the ivoryhilted steel the bridle and the glowing wheel while some cast in the dead mans gear the treacherous shield the luckless spear around they butcher herds of kine and sooth the shades with bristly swine and cattle from the neighbouring mead swift harried oer the deathfires bleed far down the line of coast they gaze on kinsmen shrivelling in the blaze ⁠and fondly watch the bier nor tear them from the hallowed ground till dewy night the sky rolls round ⁠and makes the stars appear ⁠sad latium for her part the while builds otherwhere full many a pile some on the field their slain inhume some send them forth to distant tomb ⁠or to the city bear the rest in undistinguished mass they burn unheeding rank or class the wide plains flicker through the gloom ⁠with ghastly funeral glare and now the third return of day had made the dewy night give way sighing they tumble from each pyre ⁠the hills of mingled dust and heap them tepid from the fire ⁠with mounded earthen crust but in the royal city chief swell loud and high the sounds of grief there mothers of their sons bereft young brides to widowed misery left fond hearts of sisters nigh to break and orphan boys their wailing make cry malison on turnus head and execrate his bridal bed who fain would wear italias crown alone to battle should come down ⁠to triumph or to fall loud clamours drances and attests in turnus hand the issue rests ⁠for him the trojans call and turnus too can boast his throng

saturnia cries haste—save your brother ere he dies or stir again the war and break mine be the risk the league they make she ceased and left her sore distraught with bleeding heart and wavering

foe pursue till he by force and weight oerbome dropped riverward his prey untorn ⁠and off to distance flew with loud acclaim the rutule bands ⁠salute the portent of the skies aloft they raise their eager hands ⁠and first the seer tolumnius cries for this for this my prayers have striven i hail i seize the omen given ⁠draw draw with me the sword poor rutules whom the pirate base puts like unwarlike birds in chase ⁠and spoils your riverboard yes he will fly if you pursue and vanish in the distant blue close firm your ranks and bring relief and rescue to your ravished chief ⁠all all with one accord he said and hurled as forth he ran his javelin at the foemans van the hurtling cornel cuts the skies loud clamours follow as it flies the assembly starts in mid alarm and hearts beat high with tumult warm there as nine brothers of one blood gylippus arcad offspring stood one with bright arms and beauty graced receives the javelin in his waist where chafes the belt against the groin and neath the ribs the buckles join pierced through and through he falls amain and lies extended on the plain his gallant brethren feel the smart with falchion drawn or brandished dart ⁠they charge struck blind with rage laurentums host the shock withstand like deluge bursting oer the land the trojan force the agyllan band ⁠the arcad troop engage each burns alike with frantic zeal to end the quarrel by the steel stripped are the hearths oer all the sky dense iron showers in volleys fly ⁠with eager haste they run to snatch the bowls and altarsods latinus takes his outraged gods ⁠and leaves the league undone those yoke again the battle car ⁠these vault into the selle and wave their falchions drawn for war ⁠to challenge or repel ⁠messapus singles from the rest the king aulestes richly dressed ⁠in robe and regal crown spurning the truce his horse he pressed ⁠and fiercely rides him down he with a backward spring retires and headlong falls mid altar fires ⁠that meet him in the rear up spurs messapus hot with speed and as the pale lips vainly plead drives through him towering on his steed ⁠his massy beamlike spear he has his death the victor cries heaven gains a worthier sacrifice around the corpse the italians swarm and strip the limbs yet reeking warm from blazing altar close at hand bold corynæus seized a brand as ebysus a deathwound aims full in his face he dashed the flames the bushy beard that instant flares and wafts a scent of burning hairs the conqueror rushes on his prize ⁠wreathes in his hair his hand to his broad breast his knee applies ⁠and pins him to the sand then grovelling as he lay in dust deep in his side his sword he thrust stout alsus born of shepherd race ⁠death in the forefront braves when podalirius gives him chase ⁠and high his falchion waves a ponderous axe the swain upheaves from brow to chin the head he cleaves ⁠while blood the arms oerflows a heavy slumber ironbound seals the dull eyes in rest profound ⁠in endless night they close ⁠but good æneas chides his band his head all bare unarmed his hand and whither now so fast he cries what demon bids contention rise ⁠o soothe your rage i pray the terms are fixed the treaty plight mine mine alone the combats right ⁠be calm and give me way my hand shall make the assurance true henceforward turnus is my due thus while to lay the storm he strives full on the chief an arrow drives sped by what arm what wind it came if heaven or fortune ruled its aim none knew the deed was lost to fame nor then nor after was there found who boasted of æneas wound ⁠when turnus saw æneas part ⁠retiring from his band and troys brave chiefs dismayed his heart ⁠with sudden hope he manned he calls his armour and his car leaps to his seat in pride of war ⁠and takes the reins in hand full many a gallant chief he slays or pierced on earth in torture lays drives down whole ranks in fierce career and plies the fliers with spear on spear as where cold hebrus parts the field grim mars makes thunder on his shield ⁠and stings his steeds to fight they scud the zephyrs not so fleet thrace groans beneath the hoofs quick beat his dire attendants round him fly anger and blackest treachery ⁠and gloomybrowed affright so where the battle sorest bleeds keen turnus drives his smoking steeds ⁠insulting oer the slain while gore and sand the horsehoof kneads ⁠and spirts the crimson rain thamyris and sthenelus lie dead ⁠encountered hand to hand pholus by spear from distance sped and glaucus too and lades bled whom imbrasus their father bred ⁠in native lycian land and trained alike to fight or speed like lightning with the harnessed steed now through the field eumedes came old dolons son of trojan fame his grandsires counterpart in name ⁠in courage like his sire who erst the danaan camp to spy pelides car a guerdon high ⁠from hector dared require but tydeus son with other meed requited that audacious deed ⁠and cured his proud desire him from afar when turnus views with missile dart he first pursues then quits the chariot with a bound stands oer him grovelling on the ground plants on his neck his foot and tears from his weak grasp the lance he bears deep in his throat the bright point dyes and oer the corpse in triumph cries lie there and measure out the plain the hesperian soil you sought to gain such meed they win who wish me killed tis thus their citywalls they build again he hurls his spear and sends asbytes to rejoin his friends and chloreus dares sybaris the ground in quick succession kiss thersilochus thymœtes too whose restiff steed his rider threw as when the northwinds tyrant

pride he meets the car and strives to draw ⁠the steeds proud necks aside there dragged as to the yoke he clings ⁠the spear his side has found bursts through the corslets plaited rings ⁠and prints a surface wound shifting his shield he threats the foe his sword plucks out and aims a blow when the fierce wheels with onward bound dislodge and dash him to the ground ⁠and turnus weaponed hand stretched from the car the head has reft where helm and breastplate meet and left ⁠the trunk upon the sand ⁠while turnus heaps the plain with dead æneas with achates tried and mnestheus moving at his side ⁠and young ascanius near all bleeding to the camp is led faltering and propping up his tread ⁠with guidance of a spear he frets and strives with vain essay to pluck the broken reed away demands the surest readiest aid to ope the wound with broadsword blade unflesh the barb so deep concealed and send him back to battlefield and now iapis had appeared blest leech to phœbus self endeared ⁠beyond all men below on whom the fond indulgent god his augury had fain bestowed ⁠his lyre his sounding bow but he the further to prolong ⁠a sickly parents span the humbler art of medicine chose the

former time recall each venerable name ⁠and catch heroic fire from hectors and æneas fame ⁠your uncle and your sire ⁠so speaking from the camp he passed a godlike chief of stature vast ⁠shaking his ashen beam mnestheus and antheus and their train with kindred speed oer all the plain ⁠from trench and rampart stream thick blinding dust the champaign fills and earth with trampling throbs and thrills pale turnus saw them from the height the ausonians saw and chilly fright ⁠through all their senses ran foremost of all the latian crew juturna heard the sound and knew ⁠and left the battles van onward he flies and whirls along through the wide plain his blackening throng as burst from heaven with headlong sweep a storm comes landward from the deep through rustic hearts faint terrors creep ⁠as coming ill they taste ah yes twill lay the standing corn will scatter trees from earth uptorn ⁠and make the land a waste the winds its couriers fly before and waft its muttering to the shore so the dread trojan sweeps along ⁠down on the hostile swarm in close battalions firm and strong ⁠his followers round him form osiris feels thymbræus blow ⁠at mnestheus feet anchetius lies achates slaughters epulo ⁠by gyas ufens dies een proud tolumnius falls the seer who gainst the foe first hurled his spear upsoars to heaven a mingled shout ⁠in turn the rutules yield and huddled thick in

through dust and darkness blinding black ⁠turnus alone he claims juturna agonised with fear metiscus turnus charioteer ⁠flings from his seat on high and leaves him fallen at distance far herself succeeds him guides the car ⁠and bids the coursers fly in voice in form in dress complete the hapless drivers counterfeit as swallow through some mansion flies with courts and stately galleries flaps noisy wing gives clamorous tongue still catering for her callow young makes cloisters echo to the sound and tank and cistern circles round so whirls the dame her glowing car so flashes through the maze of war now here now there in conquering pride ⁠her brother she displays yet lets him not the encounter bide ⁠but winds through devious ways nor less æneas shifts and wheels ⁠pursues and tracks him out and clamouring to his faith appeals ⁠across the weltering rout oft as he marks the foe and tries to match the chariot as it flies so oft her scourge juturna plies ⁠and turns her steeds about what should he do he undulates ⁠with aimless ebb and flow his bosoms passionate debates ⁠distract him to and fro messapus then who chanced to wield two quivering javelins barbed and steeled takes one and levels with his eye and bids it at æneas fly the trojan halts and making pause his arms around him closer draws ⁠on bended knee firm stayed the javelin struck the helmets cone and razed the plume that tossed and blown ⁠high on its summit played then surges fury high to know the baseness of the treacherous foe as horse and car he sees afar ⁠careering oer the plain to the just gods appeal he makes who watch the league that turnus breaks then charges resolute to kill lets reckless slaughter rage her fill ⁠and gives his wrath the rein ⁠o that some god would prompt my strain ⁠and all those horrors tell what gallant chiefs throughout the plain by turnus now pursued and slain ⁠now by æneas fell was it thy will almighty jove to such extreme of conflict drove two nations doomed in peace and love ⁠through after years to dwell first of the rutules sucro tried to stem the foes advancing tide ⁠but vain that brief delay æneas caught him on the side and opening ribs and bosom wide with the fell sword his fury plied ⁠brought death the swiftest way by turnus hand diores bleeds his brother amycus succeeds one from his steed by spear brought low one hand to hand by falchions blow their

peridia noble dame ⁠born in echions bed this lays in death the brethren twain from lycia phœbus own domain and young menœtes who in vain ⁠had shunned the battles roar an arcad he by lernas side his fisher craft obscurely plied ⁠contented to be poor in honest penury his sire tilled scanty ground let out to hire ⁠nor knocked at rich mans door as fires that launched on different ways stream through a wood of crackling bays or torrents that from mountain steep tumbling and thundering toward the deep ⁠plough each his own wild path æneas thus and turnus fly through the wide field now now tis nigh ⁠the boilingpoint of wrath their fierce hearts burst with rage they throw a giants force on every blow murranus that whose boastful tongue with highborn sires and grandsires rung and pedigrees of long renown through latian monarchs handed down smites with a stone of mountain size ⁠and tumbles on the sward by reins and harness caught the wheels still drag him on the horses heels beat down and crush him as he lies ⁠unmindful of their lord while this as hyllus overbold ⁠in furious onset springs through the bright helm the weapon passed and rooted in the brain stood fast nor could thy prowess cretheus brave ⁠gainst turnus coming stand nor those his gods cupencus save ⁠from out æneas hand his bosom met the impetuous blade nor long the shield its fury stayed thou too great æolus the plains

deign to end debate and humbled by his old defeat prepare once more my call to meet here here it stands the foul springhead of all this blood so basely shed quick with your torches and demand our rightful treaty fire in hand he said with emulous speed they form and rush in mass the walls to storm forth come the ladders quick as thought fire faggot pitch at once are brought some to the gates impetuous crowd ⁠and guard and sentry slay some hurl their javelins and oercloud ⁠with darts the face of day æneas foremost of the band lifts up to heaven the appealing hand ⁠beneath the ramparts shade upbraids latinus loud and long and bids the gods attest his wrong forced on another war though loth the italians twice his foes their troth ⁠a second time betrayed among the citizens within rises a wild discordant din some to the foe would ope the town ⁠the portals backward fling and to the citywalls bring down ⁠the venerable king some all on fire for weapons call and hasten to defend the wall as when some venturous swain has tracked the bees in hollow rock close packed ⁠with fumes of pungent smoke they through their waxen quarters course and murmuring passionate and hoarse ⁠their patriot rage provoke the dusk scent issues from the doors ⁠a buzzing dull and blind thrills the deep cave the smoke upsoars ⁠and mingles with the wind ⁠thus as they toil a further woe ⁠the latian realm oertook each faint heart reeled beneath the blow ⁠and the whole city shook when from the towers the queen looked down ⁠and saw the foe draw nigh the scalingladders climb the town ⁠the firebrands roofward fly at once she deemed her favourite slain keen anguish smites her wildered brain with many a curse her head she heaps sole cause of all that latium weeps and wailing oft and raving tears the gay purpureal robe she wears then fastens from a beam on high a noose in ghastly wise to die when latiums maids and matrons hear that news of wonderment and fear lavinia first her bright hair rends ⁠and wounds her rosered cheeks around her rave her mourning friends ⁠the courts repeat their shrieks from house to house wide spreads the tale the scant remains of valour fail bowed to the earth with woe on woe his consort dead his town brought low the hapless king his raiment tears and soils with dust his silver hairs ⁠while oft himself he blames who gave not to his crown an heir a bridegroom to his daughter fair ⁠nor owned æneas claims ⁠turnus meanwhile in fields afar drives straggling foes before his car slower and more slow his coursers stride and less and less their masters pride lo on the gale from distance sped come sounds of strange bewildering dread the gathering hum confused and drear of the lost city strikes his ear alas what sounds are these that rise ⁠the voice of grief and pain what tumult shakes the town he cries ⁠and wildly draws his rein his dauntless sister as she plies the chariot in metiseus guise ⁠turned round and thus began nay turnus urge we still our steeds gainst the spent foe where victory leads latiuni has sons to serve her needs ⁠her leaguered towers to man æneas on the italians falls and follows vengeance as she calls ⁠such too be turnus aim send death among his teucrian train not less your musterroll of slain ⁠nor less your share of fame sister i knew you turnus spoke when first by craft the truce you broke ⁠and plunged in battles tide and now in vain you cheat mine eye but say who sent you from the sky ⁠this cruel woe to bide from heaven you came—for what to see your brothers dying agony what can i else what hope of life holds fortune forth in such a strife but now murranus i beheld the mighty by the mighty quelled he fell invoking as he fell the recreant friend he loved too well see ufens prostrate on his face averts his eyes from my disgrace while troy rejoices in her prey his armour and his breathless clay and must i drain the dregs of shame and leave the town to sink in flame nor prompt to combat and to die make drances yet retract his lie what own defeat let latian eyes see turnus turnus as he flies ⁠is death indeed so sore hear me manes of your grace since heavenly powers have hid their face pure and unsoiled by caitiff blame i join your company nor shame ⁠my mighty sires of yore ⁠scarce had he said with headlong speed comes saces up on foaming steed his bleeding face a shaft had gored and turnus thus his voice implored turnus save you no hope is ours ⁠o think of your own race like thundercloud æneas lowers threatening to raze and sack our towers ⁠and firebrands mount apace on you is turned each latian eye ⁠latinus doubts to whom his tottering fortune to ally ⁠whom choose his daughters groom the queen your firmest friend is dead by her own hand to darkness sped messapus at the gates alone and brave atinas hold their own around them throngs the hostile band steel harvests bristle all the land you unconcerned your chariot ply through fields the battles tide leaves dry oerwhelmcd by surging thoughts of ill turnus in mute amaze stood still ⁠fierce boils in every vein indignant shame and passion blind the tempest of the lovers mind ⁠the soldiers high disdain soon as apart the shadows roll and light once more illumes his soul backward his kindling eyes he threw and grasped the town in one wide view lo tongues of flame to heaven aspire the turrets floors are wrapped in fire the tower he made to vex the foe with bridge above and wheels below the fates the fates must have their way o sister cease to breed delay where heaven and cruel fortune call there let me follow to my fall i stand to meet my foe to bear the pangs of death how keen soeer disgraced you shall not see me more let frenzy fill the space before he said and vaulting from his car plunged headlong through the opposing war his sister in her sorrow left and fierce and fast the squadrons cleft look how from mountain summit borne by wind or furious rain downtorn or gentler lapse of ages worn ⁠comes down a thundering stone headlong it falls with impulse strong the unpitying rock and whirls along ⁠woods cattle swains oerthrown so bounding onward scattering all comes turnus to the citywall where pools of bloodshed soak the ground and the shrill gales with javelins sound then signals with his upraised hand and lifts the voice of high command rutules forbear your darts lay by ye latian ranks not you but i ⁠must meet whateer betide far better this my arm alone for broken treaty should atone ⁠and battles chance decide the armies right and left give place and yield him clear and open space ⁠but great æneas when he hears ⁠the challenge of his foe the leaguer of the town forbears ⁠lets tower and rampart go steps high with exultation proud and thunders on his arms aloud vast as majestic athos vast ⁠as eryx the divine or he that roaring with the blast heaves his huge bulk in snowdrifts massed ⁠the father apennine italian trojan rutule all ⁠one way direct the eye— who man the summit of the wall who storm the base to work its fall ⁠and lay their bucklers by latinus marvels at the sight two mighty chiefs who first saw light in realms apart met here in fight ⁠the steels award to try soon as the space between is clear each rushing forward hurls his spear and bucklers clashed with brazen din the overture of fight begin earth groans fierce strokes their falchions deal chance joins with force to guide the steel as when two bulls engage in fight on silas or taburnus height ⁠and horns with horns are crossed long since the trembling hinds have fled the whole herd stands in silent dread the heifers ponder in dismay who now the countryside will sway ⁠the monarch of the host giving and taking wounds alike with furious impact home they strike shoulder and neck are bathed in gore the forest depths return the roar so shield on shield together dash ⁠æneas and his daunian foe the echo of that deafening crash ⁠mounts heavenward from below great jove with steadfast hand on high his balance poises in the sky lays in its scale each rivals fate and nicely ponders weight with weight to see whom war to doom consigns and which the side that death inclines ⁠fearless of danger with a bound young turnus rises from the ground and following on the sword he sways ⁠comes down with deadly aim latium and troy intently gaze ⁠and swell the loud acclaim when lo the faithless weapon breaks and mid the stroke its lord forsakes ⁠flight flight alone can aid swifter than wings of wind he flees soon as an unknown hilt he sees ⁠disfurnished of its blade tis said when with impatience blind ⁠he first the battle sought leaving his fathers sword behind ⁠metiscus steel he caught while routed troy before him fled that sword full well his need bested soon as twas tried on arms divine ⁠it snapped like ice in twain the mortal blade the fragments shine ⁠strewed on the yellow plain so turnus traverses the ground doubling and circling round and round ⁠in purposeless career for all about him stand his foes and here high walls the scene enclose ⁠and there a spacious mere ⁠nor less though whiles his stiffening knees ⁠slacked by his wound their work refuse æneas follows as he flees ⁠and step with step the foe pursues as tracks a hound with noise and din a deer by river deep hemmed in ⁠or plume of crimson grain the straight steep bank the threatening snare the hunted beast from progress scare ⁠she winds and winds again the umbrian keen forbids escape hangs on her flank with jaws agape snaps his vain teeth that close on nought he catching still she still uncaught turnus flies on and as he flies to every rutule loudly cries calls each by name invokes their aid and clamours for his wellknown blade æneas in imperious tone denounces death should help be shown threats the doomed town with sword and flame and wounded follows on the same five times they circle round the place five times the winding course retrace no trivial game is here the strife is waged for turnus own dear life a wilding olive on the sward ⁠sacred to faunus late had stood the seamans dutiful regard ⁠preserved that venerable wood there hung they rescued from the wave the weeds they doffed the gifts they gave when for the fight the ground was traced the trojans felled it in their haste reckless of sacred or profane that nought might break the level plain here lodged æneas javelin here it lighted borne in fierce career ⁠and in the stump stood fast he strives the weapon to unroot and whom he cannot catch on foot ⁠oertake by lances cast then out cries turnus wild with fear great faunus of thy pity hear ⁠sweet earth hold fast the steel if turnus still has held divine those sanctities which troys rude line ⁠treads down neath battles heel so prayed he nor his prayers were vain ⁠long oer the stump æneas hangs and tugs with many a fruitless strain ⁠to make the hard wood loose its fangs when lo impatient as he strives ⁠changed to metiscus shape once more forth runs the daunian fair and gives ⁠her brother back the sword he wore then venus filled with ire to see ⁠a nymph assume so bold a part approached and from the stubborn tree ⁠tore out the long imprisoned dart again the haughty chiefs advance ⁠their strength repaired their arms restored that towering with uplifted lance ⁠this waving high his faithful sword and front to front resume the game that drains the breath and racks the frame ⁠meanwhile olympus master jove ⁠addressed his queenly bride as from a yellow cloud above ⁠the warring chiefs she eyed what now the end fair consort say what latest stake remains to play long since you knew and owned you knew æneas to the skies is due a nations hero fates own power uplifts him to the starry tower what plan you now what hopes oerbold thus keep you throned aloft in cold think you twas right a god decreed by mortal treachery should bleed or turnus—for apart from you what mischief could juturna do— receive his long lost sword again and strength be waked in vanquished men tis jove entreats at length give way permit my prayers your will to sway nor brood in silent grief nor vent from those sweet lips your illcontent the end is reached by land and main i let you vex the dardan train stir guilty war a home oercloud and bridal joys with mourning shroud attempt no further joves fair queen bespoke her spouse with duteous mien ⁠your known good pleasure is the cause dread lord that juno now withdraws ⁠from turnus and the fight you would not see me else in air content to sit resigned and bear no armed with torches should i stand in battle and with red right hand ⁠my trojan foemen smite i roused i own juturnas zeal to venture for her brothers weal yet bade i not to launch the steel ⁠or bend the deadly bow by styx dire spring i take my oath the sole dread form of solemn troth ⁠olympus tenants know and now in truth behold me yield and quit for aye the accursed field vouchsafe me yet one act of grace for latiums sake your sires own race no ordinance of fate withstands the boon a nations pride demands when treaty aye and loves blest rite the warring hosts in peace unite respect the ancient stock nor make the latian tribes their style forsake nor troys nor teucers surname take nor garb nor language let them change for foreign speech and vesture strange ⁠but still abide the same let latium prosper as she will their thrones let alban monarchs fill let rome be glorious on the earth the centre of italian worth but fallen troy be fallen still ⁠the nation and the name ⁠with mirthful laughter in his eye the worlds creator made reply there joves own sister spoke indeed our father saturns other seed so vast the waves of wrath that roll in that indomitable soul but come let baffled rage give way i grant your prayer and yield the day ausonia shall abide the same unchanged in customs speech and name the sons of troy unseen though felt in fusion with the mass shall melt myself will give them rites and all still by the name of latins call the blended race that thence shall rise ⁠of mixed ausonian blood shall soar alike oer earth and skies ⁠so pious just and good nor evermore shall nation pay such homage to your shrine as they saturnia hears with altered mind ⁠triumphant now and proud the sky meantime she leaves behind ⁠and quits her chilly cloud ⁠this done the father in his heart ⁠new counsels ponders oer to force juturna to depart ⁠nor help her brother more two fiends there are of evil fame the diræ their illomened name whom at a birth unkindly night with dark megæra brought to light with serpentspires their tresses twined and gave them wings to cleave the wind on joves high threshold they appear before his throne and lash to fear ⁠mankinds unhappy brood when grisly death the sire prepares and sickness or with battle scares ⁠a guilty multitude such pest as this the thunderer sent ⁠down from the olympian sky and bade it for an omen meant ⁠across juturna fly down swoops the portent fierce and fast with swiftness of a whirling blast not swifter bounds from off the string the dart that with envenomed sting the parthian launches on the wing ⁠the parthian or the crete deathladen past the cure of art flies through the shade the hurtling dart ⁠so secret and so fleet een thus the deadly child of night shot from the sky with earthward flight soon as the armies and the town ⁠descending she descries she dwarfs her huge proportions down ⁠to bird of puny size which perched on tombs or desert towers hoots long and lone through darkling hours in such disguise the monster wheeled round turnus head and gainst his shield ⁠unceasing flapped her wings strange chilly dread his limbs unstrung upstands his hair his voiceless tongue ⁠to his parched palate clings but when from far juturna heard the whirring flight of that foul bird she rent her hair as sister mote her cheeks she tore her breast she smote ah turnus what can sister now how other prove than cruel how ⁠prolong your forfeit life can goddess meet with fearless brow a pest like this at length i bow ⁠and part me from the strife nay spare to aggravate my fear ⁠ye birds of evil wing i know the sounds that stun mine ear that deathnote speaks the bests severe ⁠of heavens imperious king no meeter guerdon can he find for maiden purity resigned why gave he life to last for aye why took the laws of death away else might i end at once my woe and with my brother pass below immortal can the thought be true o brother have i joy save you o would the earth but yawn so wide a goddess in its depth to hide ⁠and send her to the dead thus groaning in her robes of blue her head she wrapped and plunged from view ⁠down to the rivers bed ⁠æneas presses on his foe ⁠poising his treelike dart and utters ere he deals the blow ⁠the sternness of his heart what now is turnus next retreat ⁠what new escape is planned no contest this of feet with feet ⁠but deadly hand with hand take all disguises man can wear call to your succour whatsoeer ⁠or art or courage may find wings to climb the olympian steep or plunge in subterranean deep ⁠hid from the torch of day he shook his head your swelling phrase ⁠appals not turnus no the gods the gods this terror raise ⁠and jupiter my foe he said no more but looking round ⁠a mighty stone espied a mighty stone timeworn and grey which haply on the champaign lay set there erewhile the land to bound ⁠and strifes of law decide scarce twelve strong men of later mould that weight could on their necks uphold ⁠todays degenerate sons he caught it up and at his foe discharged it rising to the throw ⁠and straining as he runs but wildering fears his mind unman running he knew not that he ran ⁠nor throwing that he threw heavily move his sinking knees the streams of life wax dull and freeze the stone as through the void it past reached not the measure of its cast ⁠nor held its purpose true een as in dreams when on the eyes the drowsy weight of slumber lies in vain to ply our limbs we think and in the helpless effort sink tongue sinews all their powers bely and voice and speech our call defy so labour turnus as he will the fury mocks the endeavour still dim shapes before his senses reel ⁠on host and town he turns his sight he quails he trembles at the steel ⁠nor knows to fly nor knows to fight nor to his pleading eyes appear the car the sister charioteer ⁠the deadly dart æneas shakes his aim with stem precision takes ⁠then hurls with all his frame less loud from battering engine cast roars the fierce stone less loud the blast ⁠follows the lightnings flame on rushes as with whirlwind wings the spear that dire destruction brings makes passage through the corslets marge and enters the sevenplated targe ⁠where the last ring runs round the keen point pierces through the thigh down on his bent knee heavily ⁠comes turnus to the ground with pitying groans the rutules rise the mountain to their grief replies ⁠the lofty woods resound now fallen an upward look he sends and pleadingly his hand extends yes i have earned he cries the fate no weakling prayers may deprecate ⁠let those enjoy that win if thought of hapless sire can touch your heart—anchises once was such— show grace to daunus old and grey and me or if you will my clay ⁠send hack to home and kin yours is the victory latian bands have seen me stretch imploring hands the bride lavinia is your own thus far let foemans hate be shown ⁠rolling his eyes æneas stood and checked his sword athirst for blood now faltering more and more he felt the human heart within him melt when round the shoulder wreathed in pride the belt of pallas he espied and sudden flashed upon his view those golden studs
