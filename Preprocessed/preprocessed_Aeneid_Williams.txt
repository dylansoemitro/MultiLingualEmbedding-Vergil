juno’s sleepless wrath and much in war he suffered seeking at the last to found the city and bring o’er his fathers’ gods to safe abode in latium whence arose the latin race old alba’s reverend lords ⁠ and from her hills widewalled imperial rome o muse the causes tell what sacrilege or vengeful sorrow moved the heavenly queen to thrust on dangers dark and endless toil a man whose largest honor in men’s eyes ⁠ was serving heaven can gods such anger feel in ages gones an ancient city stood— carthage a tyrian seat which from afar made front on italy and on the mouths of tiber’s stream its wealth and revenues ⁠ were vast and ruthless was its quest of war ’t is said that juno of all lands she loved most cherished this—not samos’ self so dear here were her arms her chariot even then a throne of power o’er nations near and far ⁠ if fate opposed not ’t was her darling hope to ’stablish here but anxiously she heard that of the trojan blood there was a breed then rising which upon the destined day should utterly o’erwhelm her tyrian towers ⁠ a people of wide sway and conquest proud should compass libya’s doom—such was the web the fatal sisters spun ⁠such was the fear of saturn’s daughter who remembered well what long and unavailing strife she waged ⁠ for her loved greeks at troy nor did she fail to meditate th’ occasions of her rage and cherish deep within her bosom proud its griefs and wrongs the choice by paris made her scorned and slighted beauty a whole race ⁠ rebellious to her godhead and jove’s smile that beamed on eagleravished ganymede with all these thoughts infuriate her power pursued with tempests o’er the boundless main the trojans though by grecian victor spared ⁠ and fierce achilles so she thrust them far from latium and they drifted heavenimpelled year after year o’er many an unknown sea— o labor vast to found the roman line below th’ horizon the sicilian isle ⁠ just sank from view as for the open sea with heart of hope they said and every ship clove with its brazen beak the salt white waves but juno of her everlasting wound knew no surcease but from her heart of pain ⁠ thus darkly mused “must i defeated fail “of what i will nor turn the teucrian king “from italy away can fate oppose “had pallas power to lay waste in flame “the argive fleet and sink its mariners ⁠ “revenging but the sacrilege obscene “by ajax wrought oïleus’ desperate son “she from the clouds herself jove’s lightning threw “scattered the ships and ploughed the sea with storms “her foe from his pierced breast outbreathing fire ⁠ “in whirlwind on a deadly rock she flung “but i who move among the gods a queen “jove’s sister and his spouse with one weak tribe “make war so long who now on juno calls “what suppliant gifts henceforth her altars crown” ⁠ so in her fevered heart complaining still unto the stormcloud land the goddess came a region with wild whirlwinds in its womb æolia named where royal æolus in a highvaulted cavern keeps control ⁠ o’er warring winds and loud concoùrse of storms there closely pent in chains and bastions strong they scornful make the vacant mountain roar chafing against their bonds but from a throne of lofty crag their king with sceptred hand ⁠ allays their fury and their rage confines did he not so our ocean earth and sky were whirled before them through the vast inane but overruling jove of this in fear hid them in dungeon dark then o’er them piled ⁠ huge mountains and ordained a lawful king to hold them in firm sway or know what time with jove’s consent to loose them o’er the world to him proud juno thus made lowly plea “thou in whose hands the father of all gods ⁠ “and sovereign of mankind confides the power “to calm the waters or with winds upturn “great æolus a race with me at war “now sails the tuscan main towards italy “bringing their ilium and its vanquished powers ⁠ “uprouse thy gales strike that proud navy down “hurl far and wide and strew the waves with dead “twice seven nymphs are mine of rarest mould “of whom deïopea the most fair “i give thee in true wedlock for thine own ⁠ “to mate thy noble worth she at thy side “shall pass long happy years and fruitful bring “her beauteous offspring unto thee their sire” then æolus “’t is thy sole task o queen “to weigh thy wish and will my fealty ⁠ “thy high behest obeys this humble throne “is of thy gift thy smiles for me obtain “authority from jove thy grace concedes “my station at your bright olympian board “and gives me lordship of the darkening storm” ⁠ replying thus he smote with spear reversed the hollow mountain’s wall then rush the winds through that wide breach in long embattled line and sweep tumultuous from land to land with brooding pinions o’er the waters spread ⁠ east wind and south and boisterous afric gale upturn the sea vast billows shoreward roll the shout of mariners the creak of cordage follow the shock lowhanging clouds conceal from trojan eyes all sight of heaven and day ⁠ night o’er the ocean broods from sky to sky the thunder roll the ceaseless lightnings glare and all things mean swift death for mortal man straightway æneas shuddering with amaze groaned loud upraised both holy hands to heaven ⁠ and thus did plead “o thrice and four times blest “ye whom your sires and whom the walls of troy “looked on in your last hour o bravest son “greece ever bore tydides o that i “had fallen on ilian fields and given this life ⁠ “struck down by thy strong hand where by the spear “of great achilles fiery hector fell “and huge sarpedon where the simois “in furious flood engulfed and whirled away “so many helms and shields and heroes slain” ⁠ while thus he cried to heaven a shrieking blast smote full upon the sail up surged the waves to strike the very stars in fragments flew the shattered oars the helpless vessel veered and gave her broadside to the roaring flood ⁠ where watery mountains rose and burst and fell now high in air she hangs then yawning gulfs lay bare the shoals and sand o’er which she drives three ships a whirling south wind snatched and flung on hidden rocks—altars of sacrifice ⁠ italians call them which lie far from shore a vast ridge in the sea three ships beside an east wind blowing landward from the deep drove on the shallows—pitiable sight— and girdled them in walls of drifting sand ⁠ that ship which with his friend orontes bore the lycian mariners a great plunging wave struck straight astern before æneas’ eyes forward the steersman rolled and o’er the side fell headlong while three times the circling flood ⁠ spun the light bark through swift engulfing seas look how the lonely swimmers breast the wave and on the waste of waters wide are seen weapons of war spars planks and treasures rare once ilium’s boast all mingled with the storm ⁠ now o’er achates and ilioneus now o’er the ship of abas or aletes bursts the tempestuous shock their loosened seams yawn wide and yield the angry wave its will meanwhile how all his smitten ocean moaned ⁠ and how the tempest’s turbulent assault had vexed the stillness of his deepest cave great neptune knew and with indignant mien uplifted o’er the sea his sovereign brow he saw the teucrian navy scattered far ⁠ along the waters and æneas’ men o’erwhelmed in mingling shock of wave and sky saturnian juno’s vengeful stratagem her brother’s royal glance failed not to see and loud to eastward and to westward calling ⁠ he voiced this word “what pride of birth or power “is yours ye winds that reckless of my will “audacious thus ye ride through earth and heaven “and stir these mountain waves such rebels i— “nay first i calm this tumult but yourselves ⁠ “by heavier chastisement shall expiate “hereafter your bold trespass haste away “and bear your king this word not unto him “dominion o’er the seas and trident dread “but unto mind fate gives let him possess ⁠ “wild mountain crags thy favored haunt and home “o eurus in his barbarous mansion there “let æolus look proud and play the king “in yon closebounded prisonhouse of storms” he spoke and swiftlier than his word subdued ⁠ the swelling of the floods dispersed afar th’ assembled clouds and brought back light to heaven cymothoë then and triton with huge toil thrust down the vessels from the sharpedged reef while with the trident the great god’s own hand ⁠ assists the task then from the sandstrewn shore outebbing far he calms the whole wide sea and glides lightwheeled along the crested foam as when with not unwonted tumult roars in some vast city a rebellious mob ⁠ and baseborn passions in its bosom burn till rocks and blazing torches fill the air rage never lacks for arms—if haply then some wise man comes whose reverend looks attest a life to duty given swift silence falls ⁠ all ears are turned attentive and he sways with clear and soothing speech the people’s will so ceased the sea’s uproar when its grave sire looked o’er th’ expanse and riding on in light flung free rein to his winged obedient car ⁠ æneas’ waveworn crew now landward made and took the nearest passage whither lay the coast of libya a haven there walled in by bold sides of a rocky isle offers a spacious and secure retreat ⁠ where every billow from the distant main breaks and in many a rippling curve retires huge crags and two confronted promontories frown heavenhigh beneath whose brows outspread the silent sheltered waters on the heights ⁠ the bright and glimmering foliage seems to show a woodland amphitheatre and yet higher rises a straightstemmed grove of dense dark shade fronting on these a grotto may be seen o’erhung by steep cliffs from its inmost wall ⁠ clear springs gush out and shelving seats it has of unhewn stone a place the woodnymphs love in such a port a weary ship rides free of weight of firmfluked anchor or strong chain hither æneas of his scattered fleet ⁠ saving but seven into harbor sailed with passionate longing for the touch of land forth leapt the trojans to the welcome shore and fling their dripping limbs along the ground then good achates smote a flinty stone ⁠ secured a flashing spark heaped on light leaves and with dry branches nursed the mounting flame then ceres’ gift from the corrupting sea they bring away and wearied utterly ply ceres’ cunning on the rescued corn ⁠ and parch in flames and mill ’twixt two smooth stones æneas meanwhile climbed the cliffs and searched the wide seaprospect haply antheus there stormbuffeted might sail with his ken with biremes and his phrygian mariners ⁠ or capys or caïcus armorclad upon a towering deck no ship is seen but while he looks three stags along the shore come straying by and close behind them comes the whole herd browsing through the lowland vale ⁠ in one long line æneas stopped and seized his bow and swiftwinged arrows which his friend trusty achates close beside him bore his first shafts brought to earth the lordly heads of the highantlered chiefs his next assailed ⁠ the general herd and drove them one and all in panic through the leafy wood nor ceased the victory of his bow till on the ground lay seven huge forms one gift for every ship then back to shore he sped and to his friends ⁠ distributed the spoil with that rare wine which good acestes erst in sicily had stored in jars and princelike sent away with his loved guest—this too æneas gave and with these words their mournful mood consoled ⁠ “companions mine we have not failed to feel “calamity till now o ye have borne “far heavier sorrow jove will make an end “also of this ye sailed a course hard by “infuriate scylla’s howling cliffs and caves ⁠ “ye knew

some slice with knives and on keen prongs the quivering strips impale ⁠ place cauldrons on the shore and fan the fires then stretched at ease on couch of simple green they rally their lost powers and feast them well on seasoned wine and succulent haunch of game but hunger banished and the banquet done ⁠ in long discourse of their lost mates they tell ’twixt hopes and fears divided for who knows

heavenly task the punic hearts of stone grow soft beneath the effluence divine ⁠ and most of all the queen with heart at ease awaits benignantly her guests from troy but good æneas pondering all night long his many cares when first the cheerful dawn upon him broke resolved to take survey ⁠ of this strange country whither wind and wave had driven him—for desert land it seemed— to learn what tribes of man or beast possess a place so wild and careful tidings bring back to his friends his fleet of ships the while ⁠ where dense dark groves o’erarch a hollowed crag he left encircled in farbranching shade then with no followers save his trusty friend achates he went forth upon his way two broadtipped javelins poising in his hand ⁠ deep to the midmost wood he went and there his mother in his path uprose she seemed in garp and countenance a maid and bore like spartan maids a weapon in such guise harpalyce the thracian urges on ⁠ her panting coursers and in wild career outstrips impetuous hebrus as it flower over her lovely shoulders was a bow slender and light as fits a huntress fair her golden tresses without wimple moved ⁠ in every wind and girded in a knot her undulant vesture bared her marble knees she hailed them thus “ho sirs i pray you tell “if haply ye have noted as ye came “one of my sisters in this wood astray ⁠ “she bore a quiver and a lynx’s hide “her spotted mantle was perchance she roused “some foaming boar and chased with a loud halloo” so venus spoke and venus’ son replied “no voice or vision of thy sister fair ⁠ “has crossed my path thou maid without a name “thy

to her feet each step revealed the veritable goddess now he knew that vision was his mother and his words ⁠ pursued the fading phantom as it fled “why is thy son deluded o’er and o’er “with mocking dreams—another cruel god “hast thou no handclasp true nor interchange “of words unfeigned betwixt this heart and thine” ⁠ such word of blame he spoke and took his way toward the city’s rampart ⁠venus then o’erveiled them as they moved in darkened air— a liquid mantle of thick cloud divine— that viewless they might pass nor any wight ⁠ obstruct delay or question why they came to paphos then she soared her loved abode where stands her temple at whose hundred shrines garlands of myrtle and fresh roses breathe and clouds of orient sweetness waft away ⁠ meanwhile the wanderers swiftly journey on along the clearmarked road and soon they climb the brow of a high hill which close in view o’ertowers the city’s crown the vast exploit where lately rose but afric cabins rude ⁠ æneas wondered at the smooth wide ways the bastioned gates the uproar of the throng the tyrians toil unwearied some upraise a wall or citadel from far below lifting the ponderous stone or with due care ⁠ choose where to build and close the space around with sacred furrow in their gatheringplace the people for just governors just laws and for their reverend senate shout acclaim some clear the harbor mouth some deeply lay ⁠ the base of a great theatre and carve out proud columns from the mountain to adorn their rising stage with lofty ornament so busy bees above a field of flowers in early summer amid sunbeams toil ⁠ leading abroad their nation’s youthful brood or with the flowering honey storing close the pliant cells until they quite run o’er with nectared sweet while from the entering swarm they take their little loads or lined for war ⁠ rout the dull drones and chase them from the hive brisk is the task and all the honeyed air breathes odors of wild thyme ⁠“how blest of heaven “these men that see their promised ramparts rise” æneas sighed and swift his glances moved ⁠ from tower to tower then on his way he fared veiled in the wondercloud whence all unseen of human eyes—o strange the tale and true— he threaded the thronged streets unmarked unknown deep in the city’s heart there was a grove ⁠ of beauteous shade where once the tyrians cast here by stormful waves delved out of earth that portent which queen juno bade them find— the head of a proud horse—that ages long their boast might be wealth luxury and war ⁠ upon this spot sidonian dido raised a spacious fane to juno which became splendid with gifts and hallowed far and wide for potency divine its beams were bronze and on loud hinges swung the brazen doors ⁠ a rare new sight this sacred grove did show which calmed æneas’ fears and made him bold to hope for safety and with lifted heart from his lowfallen fortunes reaspire for while he waits the advent of the queen ⁠ he scans the mighty temple and admires the city’s opulent pride and all the skill its rival craftsmen in their work approve behold he sees old ilium’s wellfought fields in sequent picture and those famous wars ⁠ now told upon men’s lips the whole world round there atreus’ sons there kingly priam moved and fierce pelides pitiless to both æneas paused and weeping thus began “alas achates what far region now ⁠ “what land in all the world knows not our pain “see it is priam virtue’s wage is given— “o even here here also there be tears “for what men bear and mortal creatures feel “each other’s sorrow therefore have no fear ⁠ “this story of our loss forbodes us well” so saying he received into his heart that visionary scene profoundly sighed and let his plenteous tears unheeded flow there he beheld the citadel of troy ⁠ girt with embattled foes here greeks in flight some trojan onset ’scaped there phrygian bands before tallplumed achilles’ chariot sped the snowy tents of rhesus spread hard by he sees them through his tears where diomed ⁠ in night’s first watch burst o’er them unawares with bloody havoc and a host of deaths then drove his fiery coursers o’er the plain before their thirst or hunger could be stayed on trojan corn or xanthus’ cooling stream ⁠ here too was princely troilus despoiled routed and weaponless o wretched boy illmatched against achilles his wild steeds bear him along as from his chariot’s rear he falls far back

hair and lifting all in vain her hallowed pall ⁠ walked suppliant and sad beating their breasts with outspread palms but her unswerving eyes the goddess fixed on earth and would not see achilles round the trojan rampart thrice had dragged the fallen hector and for gold ⁠ was making traffic of the lifeless clay æneas groaned aloud with bursting heart to see the spoils the car the very corpse of his lost friend—while priam for the dead stretched forth in piteous prayer his helpless hands ⁠ there too his own presentment he could see surrounded by greek kings and there were shown hordes from the east and blackbrowed memnon’s arms her band of amazons with moonshaped shields penthesilea led her martial eye ⁠ flamed on from troop to troop a belt of gold beneath one bare protruded breast she bound— a warriorvirgin braving mailclad men while on such spectacle æneas’ eyes looked wondering while mute and motionless ⁠ he stood at gaze queen dido to the shrine in lovely majesty drew near a throng of youthful followers pressed round her way so by the margin of eurotas wide or o’er the cynthian steep diana leads ⁠ her bright processional hither and yon are visionary legions numberless of oreads the regnant goddess bears a quiver on her shoulders and is seen emerging tallest of her beauteous train ⁠ while joy unutterable thrills the breast of fond latona dido not less fair amid her subjects passed and not less bright her glow of gracious joy while she approved her future kingdom’s pomp and vast emprise ⁠ then at the sacred portal and beneath the temple’s vaulted dome she took her place encompassed by armed men and lifted high upon a throne her statutes and decrees the people heard and took what lot or toil ⁠ her sentence or impartial urn assigned but lo æneas sees among the throng antheus sergestus and cloanthus bold with other teucrians whom the black storm flung far o’er the deep and drove on alien shores ⁠ struck dumb was he and good achates too half gladness and half fear fain would they fly to friendship’s fond embrace but knowing not what might befall their hearts felt doubt and care therefore they kept the secret and remained ⁠ forthpeering from the hollow veil of cloud haply to learn what their friends’ fate might be or where the fleet was landed or what aim had brought them hither for a chosen few from every ship had come to sue for grace ⁠ and all the temple with their voices rang the doors swung wide and after access given and leave to speak revered ilioneus with soul serene these lowly words essayed “o queen who hast authority of jove ⁠ “to

received youth’s glowing rose an eye of joyful fire and tresses clustering fair ’t is even so the cunning craftsman unto ivory gives new beauty or with circlet of bright gold ⁠ encloses silver or the parian stone thus of the queen he sued while wonderment fell on all hearts “behold the man ye seek “for i am here æneas trojanborn “brought safely hither from yon libyan seas ⁠ “o thou who first hast

perfect sleep and to her heavenly breast enfolding him far far away upbore to fair idalia’s grove where fragrant buds of softlypetalled marjoram embower ⁠ in pleasurable shade cupid straightway obeyed

its towering form and through the cavernous womb ⁠ rolled loud reverberate rumbling deep and long if heaven’s decree if our own wills that hour had not been fixed on woe his spear had brought a bloody slaughter on our ambushed foe and troy were standing on the earth this day ⁠ o priam’s towers ye were unfallen still but lo with hands fast bound behind a youth by clamorous dardan shepherds haled

our startled souls laocoön that day by cast of lot priest unto neptune was in act to slay a huge bull at the god’s appointed fane ⁠ lo o’er the tranquil deep from tenedos appeared a pair i shudder as i tell of vastly coiling serpents side by side stretching along the waves and to the shore taking swift course their necks were lifted high ⁠ their gory dragoncrests o’ertopped the waves all else half seen trailed low along the sea while with loud cleavage of the foaming brine their monstrous backs wound forward fold on fold soon they made land the furious bright eyes ⁠ glowed with ensanguined fire their quivering tongues lapped hungrily the hissing gruesome jaws all terrorpale we fled unswerving then the monsters to laocoön made way first round the tender limbs of his two sons ⁠ each dragon coiled and on the shrinking flesh fixed fast and fled then seized they on the sire who flew to aid a javelin in his hand embracing close in bondage serpentine twice round the waist and twice in scaly grasp ⁠ around his neck and o’er him grimly peered with lifted head and crest he all the while his holy fillet fouled with venomous blood tore at his fetters with a desperate hand and lifted up such agonizing voice ⁠ as when a bull deathwounded seeks to flee the sacrificial altar and thrusts back from his doomed head the illaimed glancing blade then swiftly writhed the dragonpair away unto the templed height and in the shrine ⁠ of cruel pallas sure asylum found beneath the goddess’ feet and orbèd shield such trembling horror as we ne’er had known seized now on every heart “of his vast guilt

general acclaim ourselves did make ⁠ a breach within our walls and opened wide the ramparts of our city one and all were girded for the task smoothgliding wheels were ’neath its feet great ropes stretched round its neck till o’er our walls the fatal engine climbed ⁠ pregnant with menatarms on every side fair youths and maidens made a festal song and hauled the ropes with merry heart and gay so on and up it rolled a tower of doom and in proud menace through our forum moved ⁠ o ilium my country where abode the gods of all my sires o glorious walls of dardan’s sons before your gates it

thing cassandra then from heaveninstructed heart our doom foretold but doomed to unbelief were ilium’s sons ⁠ our hapless nation on its dying day flung free o’er streets and shrines the votive flowers the skies rolled on and o’er the ocean fell the veil of night till utmost earth and heaven and all their myrmidonian stratagems ⁠ were mantled darkly o’er in silent sleep the trojan city lay dull slumber chained its weary life but now the greek array of ordered ships moved on from tenedos their only light the silent favoring moon ⁠ on to the wellknown strand the king displayed a torch from his own ship and sinon then whom wrathful heaven defended in that hour let the imprisoned band of greeks go free from that huge womb of wood the open horse ⁠ restored them to the light and joyfully

to see hector with woeful face and streaming eyes i seemed to see him from the chariot trailing foul with dark dust and gore his swollen feet pierced with a cruel thong ah me what change ⁠ from glorious hector when he homeward bore the spoils of fierce achilles or hurled far that shower of torches on the ships of greece unkempt his beard his tresses thick with blood and all those wounds in

father’s dwelling stood apart embowered deep in trees th’ increasing din drew nearer and the battlethunder swelled ⁠ i woke on sudden and upstarting scaled the roof the tower then stood with listening ear ’t was like an harvest burning when wild winds uprouse the flames ’t was like a mountain stream that bursts in flood and ruinously whelms ⁠ sweet fields and farms and all the ploughman’s toil

vanquished in the fire ucalegon’s hard by was blazing while the waters wide around sigeum gave an answering glow shrill trumpets rang loud shouting voices roared wildly i armed me when the battle calls ⁠ how dimly reason shines i burned to join the rally of my peers and to the heights defensive gather frenzy and vast rage seized on my soul i only sought what way with sword in hand some noble death to die ⁠ when panthus met me who had scarce escaped the grecian spears—panthus of othrys’ line apollo’s priest within our citadel his holy emblems his defeated gods and his small grandson in his arms he bore ⁠ while toward the gates with wild swift steps he flew “how fares the kingdom panthus what strong place “is still our own” but scarcely could i ask when thus with many a groan he made reply— “dardania’s death and doom are come today ⁠ “implacable there is no ilium now “our trojan name is gone the teucrian throne “quite fallen for the wrathful power of jove “has given to argos all our boast and pride “the greek is lord of all yon blazing towers ⁠ “yon horse uplifted on our city’s heart “disgorges menatarms false sinon now “with scorn exultant heaps up flame on flame “others

haste for blood “our sentries helpless meet the invading shock “and give back blind and unavailing war” ⁠ by panthus’ word and by some god impelled i flew to battle where the flames leaped high where grim bellona called and all the air resounded high as heaven with shouts of war rhipeus and epytus of doughty arm ⁠ were at my side dymas and hypanis seen by a pale moon join our little band and young corœbus mygdon’s princely son who was in troy that hour because he loved cassandra madly and had made a league ⁠ as priam’s kinsman with our phrygian arms illstarred to heed not what the virgin raved when these i saw closegathered for the fight i thus addressed them “warriors vainly brave “if ye indeed desire to follow one ⁠ “who dares the uttermost brave men may do “our evil plight ye see the gods are fled “from every altar and protecting fire “which were the kingdom’s stay ye offer aid “unto your country’s ashes let us fight ⁠ “unto the death to arms my men to arms “the single hope and stay of desperate men “is their despair” thus did i rouse their souls then like the ravening wolves some night of cloud when cruel hunger in an empty maw ⁠ drives them forth furious and their whelps behind wait faminethroated so through foemen’s steel we flew to surest death and kept our way straight through the midmost town the wings of night brooded above us in vast vault of shade ⁠ but who the bloodshed of that night can tell what tongue its deaths shall number or what eyes find meed of tears to equal all its woe the ancient city fell whose throne had stood age after age along her streets were strewn ⁠ the unresisting dead at household shrines and by the temples of the gods they lay yet not alone was teucrian blood required oft out of vanquished hearts fresh valor flamed and the greek victor fell anguish and woe ⁠ were everywhere pale terrors ranged abroad and multitudinous death met every eye androgeos followed by a thronging band of greeks first met us on our desperate way but heedless and confounding friend with foe ⁠ thus all unchallenged hailed us as his own “haste heroes are ye laggards at this hour “others bear off captives and the spoil “of burning troy just from the galleys ye” he spoke but straightway when no safe reply ⁠ returned he knew himself entrapped and fallen into a foeman’s snare struck dumb was he and stopped both word and motion as one steps when blindly treading a thick path of thorns upon a snake and sick with fear would flee ⁠ that lifted wrath and swollen gorge of green so trembling did androgeos backward fall at them we flew and closed them round with war and since they could not know the ground and fear had whelmed them quite we swiftly laid them low ⁠ thus fortune on our first achievement smiled and flushed with victory corœbus cried “come friends and follow fortune’s finger where “she beckons us what path deliverance lies “change we our shields and these greek emblems wear ⁠ “’twixt guile and valor who will nicely weigh “when foes are met these dead shall find us arms” with this he dons androgeos’ crested helm and beauteous blazoned shield and to his side girds on a grecian blade young rhipeus next ⁠ with dymas and the other soldiery repeat the deed exulting and array their valor in fresh trophies from the slain now intermingled with our foes we moved and alien emblems wore the long black night ⁠ brought many a grapple and a host of greeks down to the dark we hurled some fled away seeking their safe ships and the friendly shore some cowards foul went clambering back again to that vast horse and hid them in its maw ⁠ but woe is me if gods their help withhold ’t is impious to be brave that very hour the fair cassandra passed us bound in chains king priam’s virgin daughter from the shrine and altars of minerva her loose hair ⁠ had lost its fillet her impassioned eyes were lifted in vain prayer—her eyes alone for chains of steel her frail soft hands confined corœbus’ eyes this horror not endured and sorrowcrazed he plunged him headlong in ⁠ the midmost fray selfoffered to be slain while in close mass our troop behind him poured but at this point the overwhelming spears of our own kinsmen rained resistless down from a high templetower and carnage wild ⁠ ensued because of the greek arms we bore and our false crests the howling grecian band crazed by cassandra’s rescue charged at us from every side ajax of savage soul the sons of atreus and that whole wild horde ⁠ achilles from dolopian deserts drew ’t was like the bursting storm when gales contend west wind and south and jocund wind of morn upon his orient steeds—while forests roar and foamflecked nereus with fierce trident stirs ⁠ the dark deep of the sea ⁠all who did hide in shadows of the night by our assault surprised and driven in tumultuous flight now start to view full well they now can see our shields and borrowed arms and clearly note ⁠ our speech of alien sound their multitude o’erwhelms us utterly corœbus first at mailed minerva’s altar prostrate lay pierced by peneleus’ blade then rhipeus fell we deemed him of all trojans the most just ⁠ most scrupulously righteous but the gods gave judgment otherwise there dymas died and hypanis by their compatriots slain nor thee o panthus in that mortal hour could thy clean hands or phœbus’ priesthood save ⁠ o ashes of my country funeral pyre of all my kin bear witness that my breast shrank not from any sword the grecian drew and that my deeds the night my country died deserved a warrior’s death had fate ordained ⁠ but soon our ranks were broken at my side stayed iphitus and pelias one with age was long since wearied and the other bore the burden of ulysses’ crippling wound straightway the roar and tumult summoned us ⁠ to priam’s palace where a battle raged as if to save this no conflict else were known and all troy’s dying brave were mustered there there we beheld the wargod unconfined the greek besiegers to the rooftops fled ⁠ or with shields tortoiseback the gates assailed ladders were on the walls and round by round up the huge bulwark as they fight their way the shielded lefthand thwarts the falling spears the right to every vantage closely clings ⁠ the trojans hurl whole towers and rooftops down upon the mounting foe for well they see that the last hour is come and with what arms the dying must resist rich gilded beams with many a beauteous blazon of old time ⁠ go crashing down men armed with naked swords defend the inner doors in close array thus were our hearts inflamed to stand and strike for the king’s house and to his bodyguard bring succor and renew their vanquished powers ⁠ a certain gate i knew a secret way which gave free passage between priam’s halls and exit rearward hither in the days before our fall the lone andromache was wont with young astyanax to pass ⁠ in quest of priam and her husband’s kin this way to climb the palace roof i flew where desperate the trojans with vain skill hurled forth repellent arms a tower was there reared skyward from the rooftop giving view ⁠ of troy’s wide walls and full reconnaissance of all achæa’s fleets and tented field this with strong steel our gathered strength assailed and as the loosened courses offered us great threatening fissures we uprooted it ⁠ from its aerial throne and thrust it down it fell with instantaneous crash of thunder along the danaan host in ruin wide but fresh ranks soon arrive thick showers of stone rain down with every missile rage can find ⁠ now at the threshold of the outer court pyrrhus triumphant stood with glittering arms and helm of burnished brass he glittered like some swollen viper fed on poisonleaves whom chilling winter shelters underground ⁠ till fresh and strong he sheds his annual scales and crawling forth rejuvenate uncoils his slimy length his lifted gorge insults the sunbeam with threeforked and quivering tongue huge periphas was there automedon ⁠ who drove achilles’ steeds and bore his arms then scyros’ islandwarriors assault the palaces and hurl reiterate fire at wall and tower pyrrhus led the van seizing an axe he clove the ponderous doors ⁠ and rent the hinges from their posts of bronze he cut the beams and through the solid mass burrowed his way till like a window huge the breach yawned wide and opened to his gaze a vista of long courts and corridors ⁠ the hearth and home of many an ancient king and priam’s own upon its sacred bourne the sentry all in arms kept watch and ward confusion groans and piteous turmoil were in that dwelling women shrieked and wailed ⁠ from many a dark retreat and their loud cry rang to the golden stars through those vast halls the panicstricken mothers wildly roved and clung with frantic kisses and embrace unto the columns cold fierce as his sire ⁠ pyrrhus moves on nor bar nor sentinel may stop his way down tumbles the great door beneath the battering beam and with it fall hinges and framework violently torn force bursts all bars th’ assailing greeks break in ⁠ do butchery and with menatarms possess what place they will scarce with an equal rage a foaming river when its dykes are down o’erwhelms its mounded shores and through the plain rolls mountainhigh while from the ravaged farms ⁠ its fierce flood sweeps along both flock and fold my own eyes looked on neoptolemus frenzied with slaughter and both atreus’ sons upon the threshold frowning i beheld her hundred daughters with old hecuba ⁠ and priam whose own bleeding wounds defiled the altars where himself had blessed the fires there fifty nuptial beds gave promise proud of princely heirs but all their brightness now of broidered cunning and barbaric gold ⁠ lay strewn and trampled on the danaan foe stood victor where the raging flame had failed but would ye haply know what stroke of doom on priam fell now when his anguish saw his kingdom lost and fallen his abode ⁠ shattered and in his very hearth and home th’ exulting foe the aged king did bind his rusted armor to his trembling thews— all vainly—and a useless blade of steel he girded on then charged resolved to die ⁠ encircled by the foe within his walls there stood beneath the wide and open sky a lofty altar an old laureltree leaned o’er it and enclasped in holy shade the statues of the tutelary powers ⁠ here hecuba and all the princesses took refuge vain within the place of prayer like panicstricken doves in some dark storm closegathering they sate and in despair embraced their graven gods but when the queen ⁠ saw priam with his youthful harness on “what frenzy o my wretched lord” she cried “arrayed thee in such arms o whither now “not such defences nor such arm as thine “the time requires though thy companion were ⁠ “our hector’s self o yield thee i implore “this altar now shall save us one and all “or we must die together” with these words she drew him to her side and near the shrine made for her aged spouse a place to cling ⁠ but lo just ’scaped of pyrrhus’ murderous hand polites one of priam’s sons fled fast along the corridors through thronging foes and a thick rain of spears wildly he gazed across the desolate halls wounded to death ⁠ fierce pyrrhus followed after pressing hard with mortal stroke and now his hand and spear were close upon—when the lost youth leaped forth into his father’s sight and prostrate there lay dying while his lifeblood ebbed away ⁠ then priam though on all sides death was nigh quit not the strife nor from loud wrath refrained “thy crime and impious outrage may the gods “if heaven to mortals render debt and due “justly reward and worthy honors pay ⁠ “my own son’s murder thou hast made me see “blood and pollution impiously throwing “upon a father’s head not such was he “not such achilles thy pretended sire “when priam was his foe with flush of shame ⁠ “he nobly listened to a suppliant’s plea “in honor made he rendered to the tomb “my hector’s body pale and me did send “back to my throne a king” ⁠with this proud word the aged warrior hurled with nerveless arm ⁠ his ineffectual spear which hoarsely rang rebounding on the brazen shield and hung piercing the midmost boss—but all in vain then pyrrhus “take these tidings and convey “a message to my father peleus’ son ⁠ “tell him my naughty deeds be sure and say “how neoptolemus hath shamed his sires “now die” ⁠with this he trailed before the shrines the trembling king whose feet slipped in the stream of his son’s blood then pyrrhus’ left hand clutched ⁠ the tresses old and gray a glittering sword his right hand lifted high and buried it far as the hilt in that defenceless heart so priam’s story ceased such final doom fell on him while his dying eyes surveyed ⁠ troy burning and her altars overthrown though once of many an orient land and tribe the boasted lord in huge dismemberment his severed trunk lies tombless on the shore the head from shoulder torn the corpse unknown ⁠ then first wild horror on my spirit fell and dazed me utterly a vision rose of my own cherished father as i saw the king his aged peer sore wounded lying in mortal agony a vision too ⁠ of lost creüsa at my ravaged hearth and young iulus’ peril then my eyes looked round me seeking aid but all were fled warwearied and undone some earthward leaped from battlement or tower some in despair ⁠ yielded their suffering bodies to the flame i stood there sole surviving when behold to vesta’s altar clinging in dumb fear hiding and crouching in the hallowed shade tyndarus’ daughter—’t was the burning town ⁠ lighted full well my roving steps and eyes in fear was she both of some trojan’s rage for troy o’erthrown and of some greek revenge or her wronged husband’s long indignant ire so hid she at that shrine her hateful brow ⁠ being of greece and troy full well she knew the common curse then in my bosom rose a blaze of wrath methought i should avenge my dying country and with horrid deed pay crime for crime “shall she return unscathed ⁠ “to sparta to mycenæ’s golden pride “and have a royal triumph shall her eyes “her sire and sons her hearth and husband see “while phrygian captives follow in her train “is priam murdered have the flames swept o’er ⁠ “my native troy and doth our dardan strand “sweat o’er and o’er with sanguinary dew “o not thus unavenged for though there be “no glory if i smite a woman’s crime “nor conqueror’s fame for such a victory won ⁠ “yet if i blot this monster out and wring “full punishment from guilt the time to come “will praise me and sweet pleasure it will be “to glut my soul with vengeance and appease “the ashes of my kindred” ⁠so i raved ⁠ and to such frenzied purpose gave my soul then with clear vision never had i seen her presence so unclouded i beheld in golden beams that pierced the midnight gloom my gracious mother visibly divine ⁠ and with that mien of majesty she wears when seen in heaven she stayed me with her hand and from her lips of rose this counsel gave “o son what sorrow stirs thy boundless rage “what madness this or whither vanisheth ⁠ “thy love of me wilt thou not seek to know “where bides anchises thy abandoned sire “now weak with age or if creüsa lives “and young ascanius who are ringed about “with ranks of grecian foes and long ere this— ⁠ “save that my love can shield them and defend— “had fallen on flame or fed some hungry sword “not helen’s hated beauty works thee woe “nor paris oftaccused the cruelty “of gods of gods unaided overwhelms ⁠ “thy country’s power and from its lofty height “casts ilium down behold i take away “the barriercloud that dims thy mortal eye “with murk and mist o’erveiling fear not thou “to heed thy mother’s word nor let thy heart ⁠ “refuse obedience to her counsel given “’mid yonder trembling ruins where thou see’st “stone torn from stone with dust and smoke uprolling “’t is neptune strikes the wall his trident vast “makes her foundation tremble and unseats ⁠ “the city from her throne fierce juno leads “resistless onset at the scæan gate “and summons from the ships the league of powers “wearing her wrathful sword on yonder height “behold tritonia in the citadel ⁠ “clothed with the lightning and her gorgonshield “unto the greeks great jove himself renews “their courage and their power ’t is he thrusts on “the gods themselves against the trojan arms “fly o my son the war’s wild work give o’er ⁠ “i will be always nigh and set thee safe “upon thy father’s threshold” having said she fled upon the viewless night away then loomed o’er troy the apparition vast of her dread foes divine i seemed to see ⁠ all ilium sink in fire and sacred troy of neptune’s building utterly o’erthrown so some huge ashtree on the mountain’s brow when rival woodmen heaving stroke on stroke of twoedged axes haste to cast her down ⁠ sways ominously her trembling leafy top and drops her smitten head till by her wounds vanquished at last she makes her dying groan and falls in loud wreck from the cliffs uptorn i left the citadel and led by heaven ⁠ threaded the maze of deadly foes and fires through spears that glanced aside and flames that fell soon came i to my father’s ancient seat our home and heritage but lo my sire whom first of all i sought and first would bear ⁠ to safe asylum in the distant hills vowed he could never after fallen troy live longer on or bear an exile’s woe “o you” he cried “whose blood not yet betrays “the cruel taint of time whose powers be still ⁠ “unpropped and undecayed go take your flight “if heavenly wrath had willed my life to spare “this dwelling had been safe it is too much “that i have watched one wreck and for too long “outlived my vanquished country thus o thus ⁠ “compose these limbs for death and say farewell “my own hand will procure it or my foe “will strip me bare it is an easy loss “to have no grave for many a year gone by “accursed of heaven i tarry in this world ⁠ “a useless burden since that fatal hour “when jove of gods the sire and men the king “his lightnings o’er me breathed and blasting fire” such fixed resolve he uttered o’er and o’er and would not yield though with my tears did join ⁠ my spouse creüsa fair ascanius and our whole house imploring the gray sire not with himself to ruin all nor add yet heavier burdens to our crushing doom he still cried “no” and clung to where he sate ⁠ and to the same dread purpose i once more back to the fight would speed for death alone i made my wretched prayer what space was left for wisdom now what chance or hope was given “didst thou dear father dream that i could fly ⁠ “sundered from thee did such an infamy “fall from a father’s lips if heaven’s decree “will of this mighty nation not let live “a single soul if thine own purpose be “to cast thyself and thy posterity ⁠ “into thy country’s grave behold the door “is open to thy death lo pyrrhus comes “redhanded from king priam he has slain “a son before his father’s eyes and spilt “a father’s blood upon his own hearthstone ⁠ “was it for this o heavenly mother mine “that thou hast brought me safe through sword and fire “that i might see these altars desecrate “by their worst foes that i might look upon “my sire my wife and sweet ascanius ⁠ “dead at my feet in one another’s blood “to arms my men to arms the hour of death “now beckons to the vanquished let me go “whither the greeks are gathered let me stand “where oft revives the flagging stroke of war ⁠ “not all of us unavenged this day” i clasped my swordbelt round me once again fitted my left arm to my shield and turned to fly the house but at the threshold clung creüsa to my knees and lifted up ⁠ iulus to his father’s arms “if thou “wouldst rush on death” she cried “o suffer us “to share thy perils with thee to the end “but if this day’s work bid thee trust a sword “defend thy hearthstone first who else shall guard ⁠ “thy babe iulus or thy reverend sire “or me thy wife that was—what help have i” so rang the rooftop with her piteous cries but lo a portent wonderful to see on sudden rose for while his parents’ grief ⁠ held the boy close in arm and full in view there seemed upon iulus’ head to glow a flickering peak of fire the tongue of flame innocuous o’er his clustering tresses played and hovered round his brows ⁠we horrorstruck ⁠ grasped at his burning hair and sprinkled him to quench that holy and auspicious fire then sire anchises with exultant eyes looked heavenward and lifted to the stars his voice and outstretched hands “almighty jove ⁠ “if aught of prayer may move thee let thy grace “now visit us o hear this holy vow “and if for service at thine altars done “we aught can claim o father lend us aid “and ratify the omen thou hast given” ⁠ scarce ceased his aged voice when suddenly from leftward with a deafening thunderpeal cleaving the blackness of the vaulted sky a meteorstar in trailing splendor ran exceeding bright we watched it glide sublime ⁠ o’er tower and town until its radiant beam in forestmantled ida died away but left a furrow on its track in air a glittering long line while far and wide the sulphurous fume and exhalation flowed ⁠ my father strove not now but lifted him in prayer to all the gods in holy awe of that auspicious star and thus exclaimed “tarry no moment more behold i come “whithersoe’er ye lead my steps obey ⁠ “gods of my fathers o preserve our name “preserve my son and his this augury “is yours and troy on your sole strength relies “i yield dear son i journey at thy side” he spoke and higher o’er the blazing walls ⁠ leaped the loud fire while ever nearer drew the rolling surges of tumultuous flame “haste father on these bending shoulders climb “this back is ready and the burden light “one peril smites us both whate’er befall ⁠ “one rescue both shall find close at my side “let young iulus run while not too nigh “my wife creüsa heeds what way we go “ye servants of our house give ear i pray “to my command outside the city’s gates ⁠ “lies a low mound and long since ruined fane “to ceres vowed a cypress’ ancient shade “o’erhangs it which our fathers’ pious care “protected year by year by various paths “be that our meetingplace ⁠“but in thy hands ⁠ “bring sire our household gods and sanctities “for me to touch who come this very hour “from battle and the fresh blood of the slain “were but abomination till what time “in living waters i shall make me clean” ⁠ so saying i bowed my neck and shoulders broad o’erspread me with a lion’s tawny skin and lifted up my load close at my side little iulus twined his hand in mine and followed with unequal step his sire ⁠ my wife at distance came we hastened on creeping through shadows i who once had viewed undaunted every instrument of war and all the gathered greeks in grim array now shook at every gust and heard all sounds ⁠ with fevered trepidation fearing both for him i bore and him who clasped my hand now near the gates i drew and deemed our flight safely at end when suddenly i heard the sounding tread of many warriors ⁠ that seemed hardby while through the murky night my father peered and shouted “o my son “away away for surely all our foes “are here upon us and my eyes behold “the glance of glittering shields and flash of arms” ⁠ o then some evilworking nameless god clouded my senses quite for while i sped along our pathless way and left behind all paths and regions known—o wretched me— creüsa on some dark disaster fell ⁠ she stopped or wandered or sank down undone— i never knew what way—and nevermore i looked on her alive yet knew i not my loss nor backward turned a look or thought till by that hallowed hill to ceres vowed ⁠ we gathered all—and she alone came not while husband friends and son made search in vain what god what man did not my grief accuse in frenzied word in all the ruined land what worse woe had i seen entrusting then ⁠ my sire my son and all the teucrian gods to the deep shadows of a slanting vale where my allies kept guard i hied me back to that doomed town regirt in glittering arms resolved was i all hazards to renew ⁠ all troy to reexplore and once again offer my life to perils without end the walls and gloomy gates whence forth i came i first revisit and retrace my way searching the night once more on all sides round ⁠ horror spread wide the very silence breathed a terror on my soul i hastened then back to my fallen home if haply there her feet had strayed but the invading greeks were its possessors though the hungry fire ⁠ was blown along the rooftree and the flames rolled raging upward on the fitful gale to priam’s house i haste and climb once more the citadel in juno’s temple there the chosen guardians of her wasted halls ⁠ phœnix and dread ulysses watched the spoil here snatched away from many a burning fane troy’s treasures lay—rich tables for the gods thick bowls of massy gold and vestures rare confusedly heaped up while round the pile ⁠ fair youths and trembling virgins stood forlorn yet oft my voice rang dauntless through the gloom from street to street i cried with anguish vain and on creüsa piteously calling woke the lamenting echoes o’er and o’er ⁠ while on this quest i roamed the city through of reason reft there rose upon my sight— o shape of sorrow—my creüsa’s ghost hers truly though a loftier port it wore i quailed my hair rose and i gasped for fear ⁠ but thus she spoke and soothed my grief away “why to these frenzied sorrows bend thy soul “o husband ever dear the will of heaven “hath brought all this to pass fate doth not send “creüsa the long journeys thou shalt take ⁠ “nor hath th’ olympian king so given decree “long is thy banishment thy ship must plough “the vast farspreading sea then shalt thou come “unto hesperia whose fruitful plains “are watered by the tiber lydian stream ⁠ “of smooth benignant flow thou shalt obtain “fair fortunes and a throne and royal bride “for thy beloved creüsa weep no more “no myrmidon’s proud palace waits me now “dolopian shall not scorn nor argive dames ⁠ “command a slave of dardan’s royal stem “and wife to venus’ son on these loved shores “the mother of the gods compels my stay “farewell farewell o cherish evermore “thy son and mine” ⁠her utterance scarce had ceased ⁠ when as i strove through tears to make reply she left me and dissolved in empty air thrice would my frustrate arms her form enfold thrice from the clasp of hand that vision fled like wafted winds and like a fleeting dream ⁠ the night had passed and to my friends once more i made my way much wondering to find a mighty multitude assembled there of friends newcome—matrons and menatarms and youth for exile bound—a doleful throng ⁠ from far and near they drew their hearts prepared and their possessions gathered to sail forth to lands unknown wherever o’er the wave i bade them follow ⁠now above the crest of loftiest ida rose the morningstar ⁠ chief in the front of day the greeks held fast the captive gates of troy no help or hope was ours any more then yielding all and lifting once again my aged sire for refuge to the distant hills i fled ⁠ when asia’s power and priam’s race and throne though guiltless were cast down by heaven’s decree when ilium proud had fallen and neptune’s troy in smouldering ash lay level with the ground to wandering exile then and regions wild ⁠ the gods by many an augury and sign compelled us forth we fashioned us a fleet within antander’s haven in the shade of phrygian ida’s peak though knowing not whither our fate would drive or where afford ⁠ a restingplace at last and my small band of warriors i arrayed ⁠as soon as smiled the light of summer’s prime my reverend sire anchises bade us on the winds of fate to spread all sail through tears i saw recede ⁠ my native shore the haven and the plains where once was troy an exile on the seas with son and followers and household shrines and troy’s great guardiangods i took my way there is a faroff land where warriors breed ⁠ where thracians till the boundless plains and where the crueleyed lycurgus once was king troy’s old ally it was its deities had brotherhood with ours before our fall thither i fared and on its winding shores ⁠ set my first walls though partial fate opposed our entrance there in memory of my name i called its people the æneadæ unto dione’s daughter and all gods who blessed our young emprise due gifts were paid ⁠ and unto the supreme celestial king i slew a fair white bull beside the sea but haply near my place of sacrifice a mound was seen and on the summit grew a copse of cornel and a myrtle tree ⁠ with spearlike limbs outbranched on every side this i approached and tried to rend away from its deep roots that grove of gloomy green and dress my altars in its leafy boughs but horrible to tell a prodigy ⁠ smote my astonished eyes for the first time which from the earth with broken roots i drew dripped black with bloody drops and gave the ground dark stains of gore cold horror shook my frame and every vein within me froze for fear ⁠ once more i tried from yet another stock the pliant stem to tear and to explore the mystery within—but yet again the foul bark oozed with clots of blackest gore from my deepshaken soul i made a prayer ⁠ to all the woodland nymphs and to divine gradivus patron of the thracian plain to bless this sight to lift its curse away but when at a third sheaf of myrtle spears i fell upon my knees and tugged amain ⁠ against the adverse ground i dread to tell a moaning and a wail from that deep grave burst forth and murmured in my listening ear “why wound me great æneas in my woe “o spare the dead nor let thy holy hands ⁠ “do sacrilege and sin i trojanborn “was kin of thine this blood is not of trees “haste from this murderous shore this land of greed “o i am polydorus haste away “here was i pierced a crop of iron spears ⁠ “has grown up o’er my breast and multiplied “to all these deadly javelins keen and strong” then stood i burdened with dark doubt and fear i quailed my hair rose and my utterance choked for once this polydorus with much gold ⁠ illfated priam sent by stealth away for nurture with the thracian king what time dardania’s war looked hopeless and her towers were ringed about by unrelenting siege that king when ilium’s cause was ebbing low ⁠ and fortune frowned gave o’er his plighted faith to agamemnon’s might and victory he scorned all honor and did murder foul on polydorus seizing lawlessly on all the gold o whither at thy will ⁠ curst greed of gold may mortal hearts be driven soon as my shuddering ceased i told this tale of prodigies before the people’s chiefs who sat in conclave with my kingly sire and bade them speak their reverend counsel forth ⁠ all found one voice to leave that land of sin where foul abomination had profaned a stranger’s right and once more to resign our fleet unto the tempest and the wave but fit and solemn funeral rites were paid ⁠ to polydorus a high mound we reared of heapedup earth and to his honored shade built a perpetual altar sadly drest in cypress dark and purple pall of woe our ilian women wailed with loosened hair ⁠ new milk was sprinkled from a foaming cup and from the shallow bowl fresh blood outpoured upon the sacred ground so in its tomb we laid his ghost to rest and loudly sang with prayer for peace the long the last farewell ⁠ after these things when first the friendly sea looked safe and fair and o’er its tranquil plain lightwhispering breezes bade us launch away my men drew down our galleys to the brine thronging the shore soon out of port we ran ⁠ and watched the hills and cities fading far there is a sacred island in midseas to fruitful doris and to neptune dear which grateful phœbus wielder of the bow the while it drifted loose from land to land ⁠ chained firmly where the crags of gyaros and myconos uptower and bade it rest immovable in scorn of wind and wave thither i sped by this my weary ships found undisturbed retreat and haven fair ⁠ to land we came and saw with reverent eyes apollo’s citadel king anius his people’s king and priest at phœbus’ fane came forth to meet us wearing on his brow the fillets and a holy laurel crown ⁠ unto anchises he gave greeting kind claimed old acquaintance grasped us by the hand and bade us both his roof and welcome share then kneeling at the shrine of timeworn stone “thou who at thymbra on the trojan shore ⁠ “hast often blessed my prayer o give to me “a hearth and home and to this warworn band “defensive towers and offspring multiplied “in an abiding city give to troy “a second citadel that shall survive ⁠ “achilles’ wrath and all our argive foe “whom shall we follow whither lies our way “where wilt thou grant us an abidingplace “send forth o king thy voice oracular “and on our spirits move” scarce had i spoke ⁠ when sudden trembling through the laurels ran and smote the holy portals far and wide the mighty ridges of the mountain shook and from the opening shrine the tripod moaned prostrate to earth we fall as on our ears ⁠ this utterance breaks “o breed of iron men “ye sons of dardanus the selfsame land “where bloomed at first your fardescended stem “shall to its bounteous bosom draw ye home “seek out your ancient mother there at last ⁠ “æneas’ race shall reign on every shore “and his sons’ sons and all their house to be” so phœbus spoke and mighty joy uprose from all my thronging people who would know where phœbus’ city lay and whitherward ⁠ the god ordained the wandering tribe’s return then spake my father pondering olden days and sacred memories of heroes gone “hear chiefs and princes what your hopes shall be “the isle of crete abode of lofty jove ⁠ “rests in the middle sea thence ida soars “there is the cradle of our race it boasts “a hundred cities seats of fruitful power “thence our chief sire if duly i recall “the olden tale king teucer sprung who first ⁠ “touched on the trojan shore and chose his seat “of kingly power there was no ilium then “nor towered pergama in lowly vales “their dwelling hence the ancient worship given “to the protectress of mount cybele ⁠ “mother of gods what time in ida’s grove “the brazen corybantic cymbals clang “or sacred silence guards her mystery “and lions yoked her royal chariot draw “up then and follow the behests divine ⁠ “pour offering to the winds and point your keels “unto that realm of minos it is near “if jove but bless the third day’s dawn should see “our ships at cretan land” ⁠so having said he slew the victims for each altar’s praise ⁠ a bull to neptune and a bull to thee o beauteous apollo a black lamb unto the clouds and storms but fleece and snow to the mild zephyrs was our offering the tale was told us that idomeneus ⁠ from his hereditary kingdom driven had left his crete abandoned that no foe now harbored there but all its dwellings lay untenanted of man so forth we sailed out of the port of delos and sped far ⁠ along the main the mænadhaunted hills of naxos came in view the ridges green of fair donysa with olearos and paros gleaming white and cyclades scattered among the waves as close we ran ⁠ where thickstrewn islands vex the channelled seas with rival shout the sailors cheerly called “on comrades on to crete and to our sires” freely behind us blew the friendly winds and gave smooth passage to that fabled shore ⁠ the land of the curetes friends of jove there eagerly i labored at the walls of our longprayedfor city and its name was pergamea to my trojan band pleased with such name i gave command to build ⁠ altar and hearth and raise the lofty tower but scarce the ships were beached along the strand while o’er the isle my busy mariners ploughed in new fields and took them wives once more— i giving homes and laws when suddenly ⁠ a pestilence from some infectious sky seized on man’s flesh and horribly exhaled o’er trees and crops a fatal year of plague some breathed their last while others weak and worn lived on the dogstar parched the barren fields ⁠ grass withered and the sickly mouldering corn refused us life my aged father then bade us recross the waves and reimplore apollo’s mercy at his island shrine if haply of our weariness and woe ⁠ he might vouchsafe the end or bid us find help for our task or guidance o’er the sea ’t was night and sleep possessed all breathing things when lo the sacred effigies divine the phrygian gods which through the flames i bore ⁠ from fallen troy seemed in a vision clear to stand before me where i slumbering lay bathed in bright beams which from the moon at full streamed through the latticed wall and thus they spoke to soothe my care away “apollo’s word ⁠ “which in far delos the god meant for thee “is uttered here behold he sends ourselves “to this thy house before thy prayer is made “we from troy’s ashes have companioned thee “in every fight and we the swollen seas ⁠ “guided by thee in thine own ships have crossed “our prayer divine shall set among the stars “thy seed to be and to thy city give “dominion evermore for mighty men “go build its mighty walls seek not to shun ⁠ “the hard long labors of an exile’s way “change this abode not thine this cretan shore “nor here would delian phœbus have thee bide “there is a land the roving greeks have named “hesperia it is a storied realm ⁠ “made mighty by great wars and fruitful glebe “œnotrians had it and their sons ’t is said “have called it italy a chieftain’s name “to a whole region given that land alone “our true abode can be for dardanus ⁠ “was cradled there and old iasius “the venerated sire of all our line “arise go forth and cheer thy father gray “with the glad tidings bid him doubt no more “ausonia seek and corythus for jove ⁠ “denies this cretan realm to thine and thee” i marvelled at the heavenly presences so vocal and so bright for ’t was not sleep but face to face i deemed i could discern each countenance august and holy brow ⁠ each mantled head and from my body ran cold sweat of awe from my low couch i sprang lifting to heaven my suppliant hands and prayer and o’er my hearth poured forth libations free after th’ auspicious offering i told ⁠ anchises the whole tale in order due he owned our stock twobranched of our great sires the twofold line and that his thought had strayed in new confusion mingling ancient names then spoke “o son in ilium’s doom severe ⁠ “afflicted ever to my ears alone “this dark vicissitude cassandra sang “i mind me now that her wild tongue foretold “such destiny for oft she called aloud “‘hesperia’ oft ‘italia’s kingdom’ called ⁠ “but who had faith that teucer’s sons should come “to far hesperia what mortal ear “gave heed to sad cassandra’s voice divine “now phœbus speaks obedient let us be “and warned by him our happier lot pursue” ⁠ he spoke with heart of hope we all obeyed again we changed abode and leaving there a feeble few again with spreading sails we coursed in hollow ship the spacious sea when from the deep the shores had faded far ⁠ and only sky and sea were round our way full in the zenith hung a purple cloud stormladen dark as night and every wave grew black and angry while perpetual gales came rolling o’er the main and mountainhigh ⁠ the wreckful surges rose our ships were hurled wide o’er the whirling waters thunderclouds and misty murk of night made end of all the light of heaven save where the rifted storm flashed with the oftreiterate shaft of jove ⁠ then went we drifting beaten from our course upon a trackless sea not even the eyes of palinurus could tell night from noon or ken our way three days of blinding dark three nights without a star we roved the seas ⁠ the fourth land seemed to rise far distant hills and rolling smoke we saw down came our sails out flew the oars and with prompt stroke the crews swept the dark waves and tossed the crested foam from such seaperil safe i made the shores ⁠ of strophades—a name the grecians gave to islands in the broad ionic main— the strophades where dread celæno bides with other harpies who had quit the halls of stricken phineus and for very fear ⁠ fled from the routed feast no prodigy more vile than these nor plague more pitiless ere rose by wrath divine from stygian wave birds seem they but with face like womankind foulflowing bellies hands covered with crooked claws ⁠ and ghastly lips they have with hunger pale scarce had we made the haven when behold fair herds of cattle roaming a wide plain and horned goats untended feeding free in pastures green surprised our happy eyes ⁠ with eager blades we ran to take and slay asking of every god and chiefly jove to share the welcome prize we ranged a feast with turfbuilt couches and a banquetboard along the curving strand but in a trice ⁠ down from the high hills swooping horribly the harpies loudly shrieking flapped their wings snatched at our meats and with infectious touch polluted all infernal was their cry the stench most vile once more in covert far ⁠ beneath a caverned rock and close concealed with trees and branching shade we raised aloft our tables altars and rekindled fires once more from haunts unknown the clamorous flock from every quarter flew and seized its prey ⁠ with taloned feet and carrion lip most foul i called my mates to arms and opened war on that accursed brood my band obeyed and hiding in deep grass their swords and shields in ambush lay but presently the foe ⁠ swept o’er the winding shore with loud alarm then from a sentrycrag misenus blew a signal on his hollow horn my men flew to the combat strange and fain would wound with martial steel those foul birds of the sea ⁠ but on their sides no wounding blade could fall nor any plume be marred in swiftest flight to starry skies they soared and left on earth their halfgnawed stolen feast and footprints foul celæno only on a beetling crag ⁠ took lofty perch and prophetess of ill shrieked malediction from her vulture breast “because of slaughtered kine and ravished herd “sons of laomedon have ye made war “and will ye from their rightful kingdom drive ⁠ “the guiltless harpies hear o hear my word “long in your bosoms may it rankle sore “which jove omnipotent to phœbus gave “phœbus gave to me a word of doom which i “the furies’ elder sister here unfold ⁠ “‘to italy ye fare

“‘by you unjustly spilt your famished jaws “‘bite at your tables aye—and half devour’” she spoke her pinions bore her to the grove and she was seen no more but all my band shuddered with shock of fear in each cold vein ⁠ their drooping spirits trusted swords no more but turned to prayers and offerings asking grace scarce knowing if those creatures were divine or but vast birds illomened and unclean father anchises to the gods in heaven ⁠ uplifted suppliant hands and on that shore due ritual made crying aloud “ye gods “avert this curse this evil turn away “smile heaven upon your faithful votaries” then bade he launch away the chain undo ⁠ set every cable free and spread all sail o’er the white waves we flew and took our way where’er the helmsman or the winds could guide now forestclad zacynthus met our gaze engirdled by the waves dulichium ⁠ samè and neritos a rocky steep uprose we passed the cliffs of ithaca that called laertes king and flung our curse on fierce ulysses’ hearth and native land nigh hoar lucate’s clouded crest we drew ⁠ where phœbus’ temple feared by mariners loomed o’er us thitherward we steered and reached the little port and town our weary fleet dropped anchor and lay beached along the strand so safe at land our hopeless peril past ⁠ we offered thanks to jove and kindled high his altars with our feast and sacrifice then gathering on actium’s holy shore made fair solemnities of pomp and game my youth anointing their smooth naked limbs ⁠ wrestled our wonted way for glad were we who past so many isles of greece had sped and ’scaped our circling foes now had the sun rolled through the year’s full circle and the waves were rough with icy winter’s northern gales ⁠ i hung for trophy on that temple door a swelling shield of brass which once was worn by mighty abas graven with this line spoil of æneas from triumphant foes then from that haven i command them forth ⁠ my good crews take the thwarts smiting the sea with rival strokes and skim the level main soon sank phæacia’s windswept citadels out of our view we skirted the bold shores of proud epirus in chaonian land ⁠ and made buthrotum’s port and towering town here wondrous tidings met us that the son of priam helenus held kingly sway o’er many argive cities having wed the queen of pyrrhus great achilles’ son ⁠ and gained his throne and that andromache once more was wife unto a kindred lord amazement held me all my bosom burned to see the hero’s face and hear this tale of strange vicissitude so up i climbed ⁠ leaving the haven fleet and friendly shore that selfsame hour outside the city walls within a grove where flowed the mimic stream of a new simois andromache with offerings to the dead and gifts of woe ⁠ poured forth libation and invoked the shade of hector at a tomb which her fond grief had consecrated to perpetual tears though void a mound of fair green turf it stood and near it rose twin altars to his name ⁠ she saw me drawing near our trojan helms met her bewildered eyes and terrorstruck at the portentous sight she swooning fell and lay cold rigid lifeless till at last scarce finding voice her lips addressed me thus ⁠ “have i true vision bringest thou the word “of truth o goddessborn art still in flesh “or if sweet light be fled my hector where” with flood of tears she spoke and all the grove reëchoed to her cry scarce could i frame ⁠ brief answer to her passion but replied with broken voice and accents faltering “i live ’tis true i lengthen out my days “through many a desperate strait but o believe “that what thine eyes behold is vision true ⁠ “alas what lot is thine that wert unthroned “from such a husband’s side what afterfate “could give thee honor due andromache “once hector’s wife is pyrrhus still thy lord” “with drooping brows and lowly voice she cried ⁠ “o happy only was that virgin blest “daughter of priam summoned forth to die “in sight of ilium on a foeman’s tomb “no casting of the lot her doom decreed “nor came she to her conqueror’s couch a slave ⁠ “myself from burning ilium carried far “o’er seas and seas endured the swollen pride “of that young scion of achilles’ race “and bore him as his slave a son when he “sued

“ascanius still breathes he earthly air ⁠ “in troy she bore him—is he mourning still “that mother ravished from his childhood’s eyes “what ancient valor stirs the manly soul “of thine own son of hector’s sister’s child” thus poured she forth full many a doleful word ⁠ with unavailing tears but as she ceased out of the city gates appeared the son of priam helenus with princely train he welcomed us as kin and glad at heart gave guidance to his house though oft his words ⁠ fell faltering and few with many a tear soon to a humbler troy i lift my eyes and of a mightier pergamus discern the towering semblance there a scanty stream runs on in xanthus’ name and my glad arms ⁠ the pillars of a scæan gate embrace my teucrian mariners with welcome free enjoyed the friendly town his ample halls our royal host threw wide full winecups flowed within the palace golden feast was spread ⁠ and many a goblet quaffed day followed day while favoring breezes beckoned us to sea and swelled the waiting canvas as they blew then to the prophetpriest i made this prayer “offspring of troy interpreter of heaven ⁠ “who knowest phœbus’ power and readest well “the tripod stars and vocal laurel

fardistant shores “but lone celæno heralding strange woe “foretold prodigious horror vengeance dark “and vile unnatural hunger how elude ⁠ “such perils or by what hard duty done “may such huge host of evils vanquished be” then helenus with sacrifice of kine in order due implored the grace of heaven unloosed the fillets from his sacred brow ⁠ and led me phœbus to thy temple’s door awed by th’

the seas we sped and kept our course ⁠ nigh the ceraunian headland where begins the short seapassage unto italy soon sank the sun while down the shadowed hills stole deeper gloom then making shore we flung our bodies on a dry seabordering sand ⁠ couched on earth’s welcome breast the oars were ranged in order due the tides of slumber dark o’erflowed our lives but scarce the chariot of night on wings of swift obedient hours had touched the middle sky when wakeful sprang ⁠ good palinurus from his pillowed stone with hand at ear he caught each airy gust and questioned of the winds the gliding stars he called by name as onward they advanced through the still heaven arcturus he beheld ⁠ the hyades rainbringers the twin bears and vast orion girt in golden arms he blew a trumpet from his ship our camp stirred to the signal for embarking soon we rode the seas once more with swelling sail ⁠ scarce had aurora’s purple from the sky warned off the stars when lying very low along th’ horizon the dimmed hills we saw of italy achates first gave cry “italia” with answering shouts of joy ⁠ my comrades’ voices cried “italia hail” anchises then wreathed a great bowl with flowers and filled with wine invoking heaven to bless and thus he prayed from our ship’s lofty stern “o lords of land and sea and every storm ⁠ “breathe favoring breezes for our onward way” fresh blew the prayedfor winds a haven fair soon widened near us and its heights were crowned by a greek fane to pallas yet my men furled sail and shoreward veered the pointing prow ⁠ the port receding from the orient wave is curved into a bow on either side the jutting headlands toss the salt seafoam and hide the bay itself like double wall the towered crags send down protecting arms ⁠ while distant from the shore the temple stands here on a green sward the first omen given i saw four horses grazing through the field each white as snow father anchises cried “is war thy gift o new and alien land ⁠ “horses make war of war these creatures bode “yet oft before the chariot of peace “their swift hoofs go and on their necks they bear “th’ obedient yoke and rein therefore a hope “of peace is also ours” then we implored ⁠ minerva’s mercy at her sacred shrine the mailclad goddess who gave welcome there and at an altar mantling well our brows the phrygian way as helenus ordained we paid the honors his chief counsel urged ⁠ with blameless rite to juno argive queen no tarrying now but after sacrifice we twirled the sailyards and shook out all sail leaving the cities of the sons of greece and that distrusted land tarentum’s bay ⁠ soon smiled before us town of hercules if fame be true opposing it uptowers lacinia’s headland unto juno dear the heights of caulon and that sailor’s bane shipshattering scylaceum thence half seen ⁠ trinacrian ætna cleaves th’ horizon line we hear from far the crash of shouting seas where lifted billows leap the tideswept sand father anchises cried “’tis none but she— “charybdis helenus this reef foretold ⁠ “and rocks of dreadful name o fly my men “rise like one man with long strong sweep of oars” not unobedient they first palinure veered to the leftward wave the willing keel and sails and oars together leftward strove ⁠ we shot to skyward on the arching surge then as she sank dropped deeper than the grave thrice bellowed the vast cliffs from vaulted wall thrice saw we spouted foam and showers of stars after these things both wind and sun did fail ⁠ and weary worn not witting of our way we drifted shoreward to the cyclops’ land a spreading bay is there impregnable to all invading storms and ætna’s throat with roar of frightful ruin thunders nigh ⁠ now to the realm of light it lifts a cloud of pitchblack whirling smoke and fiery dust shooting out globes of flame with monster tongues that lick the stars now huge crags of itself out of the bowels of the mountain torn ⁠ its maw disgorges while the molten rock rolls screaming skyward from the nether deep the fathomless abyss makes ebb and flow enceladus his body lightningscarred lies prisoned under all so runs the tale ⁠ o’er him gigantic ætna breathes in fire from crack and seam and if he haply turn to change his wearied side trinacria’s isle trembles and moans and thick fumes mantle heaven that night in screen and covert of a grove ⁠ we bore the dire convulsion unaware whence the loud horror came for not a star its lamp allowed but all was gloom and frowning night confined the moon in cloud when from the eastern waves the light of morn ⁠ began to peer and from the upper sky aurora flamed away the dark and dew out of the forest sprang a startling shape of hungerwasted misery a man in wretched guise who shoreward came with hands ⁠ outstretched in supplication we turned back and scanned him well all grime and foulness he with long and tangled beard his savage garb fastened with thorns but in all else he seemed a greek and in his country’s league of arms ⁠ sent to the siege of troy when he beheld the dardan habit and our trojan steel he somewhat paused as if in dread dismay such sight to see and falteringly moved but soon with headlong steps he sought the shore ⁠ ejaculating broken sobs and prayers “by stars above by gods on high o hear “by this bright heavenly air we mortals breathe “save me sweet trojans carry me away “unto what land ye will i ask no more ⁠ “i came i know it in the ships of greece “and i did war ’t is true with ilium’s gods “o if the crime deserve it fling my corse “on yonder waves and in the boundless brine “sink me forever give me in my death ⁠ “the comfort that by human hands i die” he clasped our knees and writhing on his own clung fast we bid him tell his race and name and by what fate pursued anchises gave his own right hand in swift and generous aid ⁠ and by prompt token cheered the exile’s heart who banishing his fears poured forth this tale— “my home was ithaca and i partook “the fortunes of ulysses evilstarred “my name is achemenides my sire ⁠ “was adamastus and i sailed for troy “being so poor—o that i ne’er had changed “the lot i bore in yon vast cyclops’ cave “my comrades flying from its gruesome door “left me behind forgotten ’t is a house ⁠ “of gory feasts of flesh ’t is deep and dark “and vaulted high he looms as high as heaven “i pray the blessèd gods to rid the earth “of the vile monster none can look on him “none speak with him he feeds on clotted gore ⁠ “of disembowelled men these very eyes “saw him seize two of our own company “and as he lolled back in the cave he clutched “and dashed them on the stones fouling the floor “with torrent of their blood myself i saw him ⁠ “crunch with his teeth the dripping bloody limbs “still hot and pulsing on his hungry jaw “but not without reward for such a sight “ulysses would not brook and ithaca “forgot not in such strait the name he bore ⁠ “for soon as gorged with feasting and o’ercome “with drunken slumber the foul giant lay “sprawled through the cave his head dropped helpless down “disgorging as he slept thick drool of gore “and gobbets drenched with bloody wine then we ⁠ “calling on heaven and taking place by lot “drew round him like one man and with a beam “sharpened at end bored out that monster eye “which huge and sole lay under the grim brow “round as an argive shield or phœbus’ star ⁠ “thus took we joyful vengeance for the shades “of our lost mates but o illfated men “fly i implore and cut the cables free “along the beach for in the land abide “like polyphemus who in hollow cave ⁠ “kept fleecy sheep and milked his fruitful ewes “a hundred other huge as he who rove “wide o’er this winding shore and mountains fair “cyclops accursèd bestial thrice the moon “has filled her horns with light while here i dwell ⁠ “in lonely woods and lairs of creatures wild “or from tall cliffs outpeering i discern “the cyclops and shrink shuddering from the sound “of their vast step and cry my sorry fare “is berries and hard cornels dropped from trees ⁠ “or herbroots torn out from the niggard ground “though watching the whole sea only today “have i had sight of ships to you i fled “whate’er ye be it was my only prayer “to ’scape that monster brood i ask no more ⁠ “o set me free by any death ye will” he scarce had said when moving o’er the crest of a high hill a giant shape we saw that shepherd polyphemus with his flocks downwending to the wellknown waterside ⁠ huge shapeless horrible with blinded eye bearing a lopped pine for a staff he made his footing sure while the white fleecy sheep sole pleasure now and solace of his woes ran huddling at his side ⁠ soon to the vast flood of the level brine he came and washed the flowing gore away from that outhollowed eye he gnashed his teeth groaning and deep into the watery way stalked on his tall bulk wet by scarce a wave ⁠ we fled in haste though far and with us bore the truthful suppliant cut silently the anchorropes and bending to the oar swept on with eager strokes clean out to sea aware he was and toward our loud halloo ⁠ whirled sudden round but when no power had he to seize or harm nor could his fierce pursuit o’ertake the ionian surges as they rolled he raised a cry incredible the sea with all its billows trembled the wide shore ⁠ of italy from glens and gorges moaned and ætna roared from every vaulted cave then rallied from the groveclad lofty isle the cyclops’ clan and lined the beach and bay we saw each lonely eyeball glare in vain ⁠ as side by side those brothers ætnaborn stood towering high a conclave dark and dire as when far up some mountain’s famous crest windfronting oaks or coneclad cypresses have made assembling in the solemn hills ⁠ jove’s giant wood or dian’s sacred grove we terrorstruck would fly we knew not where with loosened sheet and canvas swelling strong before a welcome wind but helenus bade us both scylla and charybdis fear ⁠ where ’twixt the twain death straitly hems the way and so the counsel was to veer our bark the course it came but lo a northern gale burst o’er us from pelorus’ narrowed side and on we rode far past pantagia’s bay ⁠ of unhewn rock and past the haven strong of megara and thapsus lying low such were the names retold and such the shores shown us by achemenides whose fate made him familiar there for he had sailed ⁠ with evilstarred ulysses o’er that sea off the sicilian shore an island lies wavewashed plemmyrium called in olden days ortygia here alpheus rivergod from elis flowed by secret sluice they say ⁠ beneath the sea and mingles at thy mouth fair arethusa with sicilian waves our voices hailed the great gods of the land with reverent prayer then skirted we the shore where smooth helorus floods the fruitful plain ⁠ under pachynus’ beetling precipice we kept our course then camarína rose in distant view firmseated evermore by fate’s decree and that farspreading vale of gela with the name of power it takes ⁠ from its wide river and uptowering far the ramparts of proud acragus appeared where fiery steeds were bred in days of old borne by the winds along thy coast i fled selinus green with palm and past the shore ⁠ of lilybæum with its treacherous reef till at the last the port of drepanum received me to its melancholy strand here woe is me outworn by stormful seas my sire sole comfort of my grievous doom ⁠ anchises ceased to be o best of sires here didst thou leave me in the weary way through all our perils—o the bitter loss— borne safely but in vain king helenus whose prophettongue of dark events foretold ⁠ spoke not this woe nor did celæno’s curse of this forebode such my last loss and pain such of my weary way the destined goal from thence departing the divine behest impelled me to thy shores o listening queen ⁠ such was while all gave ear the tale sublime father æneas none but he set forth of wanderings and of dark decrees divine silent at last he ceased and took repose
